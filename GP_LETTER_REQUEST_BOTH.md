# GP Letter Request - For Vodafone and Crest Nicholson

Dear Dr Wade-West,

Following our consultation last Friday, I would be grateful if you could prepare two letters regarding the impact of our housing situation on our family's health. These letters are crucial for resolving our situation.

## Letter 1: For Vodafone (Credit Default Removal)

### Background for the Letter
The Taylor family has endured an ordeal with a new build company for almost 4 years, involving 2 consecutive properties with defects. This is their second property from the same builder with issues. The current property has structural faults confirmed by the New Homes Ombudsman (NHOS), who upheld Mr Taylor's complaint in full and ordered the builder to fix issues requiring:
- Complete render removal from multiple elevations
- Cutting structural joints into the house in at least 4 places, top to bottom
- Weber (the render manufacturer) has advised this work will damage the house due to render absorption into blockwork
- The manufacturer states this should "never be done" as it causes "more harm than good"

This leaves our family trapped - the builder is legally required to perform work that will damage our home further.

### What to Confirm
- The 4-year duration of housing stress across two properties
- The acute stress consumed Mr Taylor's emotional capacity for normal household management
- During this crisis, a Vodafone payment was overlooked
- This oversight was discovered as a credit default, just as the family seeks mortgage flexibility to escape
- Such administrative oversight is consistent with the documented stress levels
- Immediate payment upon discovery demonstrates this was crisis-related, not financial difficulty

### Professional Medical Opinion to Include
- This is the second consecutive property from the same builder with defects - a pattern that has compounded the psychological impact
- The NHOS upheld Mr Taylor's complaint in full, providing regulatory validation of his concerns after 18 months of denials
- The family is trapped in a harmful situation with a property that has caused significant psychological distress
- Pattern of broken promises, denial of defects for 18 months, and financial harm has created a toxic environment
- The family desperately needs to leave this damaging situation for their mental health
- The credit default is now the primary barrier preventing them from escaping
- From a medical perspective, removing this barrier is crucial for the family's recovery
- Request that Vodafone lift the default given these exceptional circumstances
- The family needs mortgage flexibility to move to a properly-built home

## Letter 2: For Crest Nicholson (The Builder)

### What to Confirm
- The ongoing impact on the entire family's mental health
- Mr Taylor's recent acute episode (July 2025)
- The NHOS has mandated that Crest must implement their surveyor's findings (movement joint installation)
- However, Weber (the render manufacturer) has confirmed this NHOS-mandated work will "undoubtedly destroy" parts of our home
- Weber specifically states: "removing render especially bonded render is never a good choice, yes its very messy, very disruptive and very noisy"
- The render removal alone requires "mechanical tools and mechanised force" and "the face of the outer leaf will undoubtable be destroyed"
- Weber confirms render removal causes "more harm than good" and should only be done "as a last resort"
- The regulator's decision to uphold the complaint is welcome, but they are unaware of the technical impossibility of the remedy
- Mr Taylor only discovered this technical problem after contacting Weber directly - Crest should have known this already
- This creates an impossible situation: the regulator orders work that the manufacturer says should "never be done"
- Living through such destructive, noisy, disruptive work would be harmful to the family's wellbeing
- The prospect of our home being damaged further by NHOS-mandated repairs is causing additional distress
- Our son has been particularly affected by the ongoing housing uncertainty

### Professional Medical Opinion to Include
- This is the second consecutive property from the same builder with defects - a pattern that has compounded the psychological impact
- The NHOS upheld Mr Taylor's complaint in full, validating his concerns after 18 months of denials
- The Taylor family should not be forced to remain in a property that was built incorrectly (as confirmed by NHOS decision)
- The render manufacturer's statement that removal will cause more harm than good creates an impossible situation
- From a medical perspective, the healthiest resolution would be for Crest to buy back the property
- This would allow the family to move forward without enduring further trauma from destructive remediation
- Continuing to live in or through repairs to a structurally defective property is detrimental to the family's mental health
- A buyback would provide the clean break needed for psychological recovery

### For Both Letters
- Resolution is urgently needed for the family's wellbeing

Thank you for your help in documenting the medical impact of this prolonged housing crisis.

Paul Taylor
