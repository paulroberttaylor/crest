QUALITY
CODE
THE REGISTER
OF DEVELOPERS
From January 2022, housebuilders and developers who
build new homes will be expected to register with the
New Homes Quality Board (“NHQB”). A housebuilder/
developer who has followed the required registration
process, including completion of training and introduction
of necessary complaints and other processes and
procedures to meet the requirements of the Code, will
become a Registered Developer.
Registered Developers agree to follow the
New Homes Quality Code (the "Code")
and to be subject to a New Homes
Ombudsman Scheme (once established),
including complying with the decisions of
a New Homes Ombudsman in relation to
dealings with a Customer. Failure to meet the
required standards, or comply with a New
Homes Ombudsman, can result in a range of
sanctions, including removal from the register
of Registered Developers.
The Code establishes mandatory
requirements which must be adopted and
complied with by Registered Developers. The
Code may be updated from time to time, to
reflect emerging industry best practice as well
as decisions of a New Homes Ombudsman.
Each amended or updated Code will come
into force in such manner and at such time
as set out by resolution of the New Homes
Quality Board.
All Registered Developers are expected
to build homes that comply with building
safety and other regulatory requirements.
All Registered Developers should aim to
handover homes that are free from Snags
or Defects and, where they do occur, they
should be resolved within the agreed
timescales.
A Customer for the purposes of this Code
means an individual buying or intending to
buy a new home for their own occupation
or on behalf of an individual beneficiary.
However, while this version of the Code
has been developed with the specific
needs of Customers who are buying their
home for their own occupation, the New
Homes Quality Board has initiated work to
consider other groups of customers and their
expectations in relation to a New Home.
This includes shared owners and individuals
who are letting homes to other individuals.
Any changes to the Code to reflect the
needs to any additional or different groups
will be developed through consultation and
resolution of the Board, which will continually
assess and review the effectiveness of the
Code, and any emerging legislative or
regulatory requirements.
The Code has two parts:
1. A Statement of Fundamental Principles
a statement of the Fundamental
Principles that Registered Developers
agree to apply in their business and their
dealings with Customers; and
2. The Practical Steps – a statement of
what is expected at each stage of the
process.
In addition to the Code:
Developer Guidance may be provided,
amended or supplemented from to time in
order to assist Registered Developers in the
operation of the Requirements, including
training materials and example documents.
Customer Guidance may be provided,
amended or supplemented from time to time
to assist customers in matters such as how to
make a complaint under the Code and what
to expect from their Registered Developer.
Glossary: there is a glossary of terms which
accompanies the Code and words shown
with initial capitals are defined within the
Glossary.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Developer
Guidance and the Customer Guidance
do not supersede or replace any of
the Statement of Principles or Practical
Steps of the Code with which Registered
Developers must comply.
Transition Arrangements – Transition Period
Developers will be expected to have
registered with the New Homes Quality
Board by no later than 31 December 2022
(the Final Registration Date).
Following Registration, Developers will
have time to confirm their readiness
to transition to the new arrangements,
including training, branding, etc. (the
Transition Period). Developers may
choose to activate regional businesses or
subsidiaries at different times.
During this period from the opening of
applications for the register of Developers
in January 2022 up to the Final Transition
Date, being the Transition Period, developers
must clearly advise Customers whether
the provisions of this Code or a legacy
arrangement apply to their New Home.
Application in England, Northern Ireland,
Scotland and Wales
The remit of the New Homes Quality Board
covers Great Britain. The provisions of
the Code and the establishment of a New
Homes Ombudsman are intended to apply
in each of the nations.
A final version of the Code will be published
ahead of the Transition Period taking effect.
A Welsh language version of the Code will
also be published at that time.
There are some legal differences between
the laws applying in England and Wales to
those applying in Scotland. Professional
advice should also be taken in relation
to specific laws in each legal jurisdiction
of the UK and to ensure compliance in
accordance with those laws.
Issued by resolution of the New Homes
Quality Board, December 2021.

Part One: Selling a new home
1.3 No high-pressure selling techniques
High-pressure selling techniques must not be used by the Developer to influence
a Customer's decision.
High-pressure selling techniques not to be used by the Developer to influence a
Customer's decision include (but are not limited to):
a) encouraging a Reservation by implying that there are other interested parties or that there
is an imminent price increase due, where neither is true.
b) offering a financial incentive for an immediate decision on a Reservation or a sale.
c) encouraging a Reservation by refusing the opportunity to personalise the New Home
where the stage of construction would still allow it.
d) encouraging the purchase of any unnecessary or inappropriate additional insurance
products, warranties or guarantees.
e) suggesting that a sale may not proceed unless a Customer uses a specific third-party
Professional Adviser such as conveyancer or mortgage broker.

matters set out specifically in relation to part-exchange and assisted move schemes
(Section 1.4 below).

b) the price offered for the part exchange property.
Part One: Selling a new home
1.5 Considering Vulnerable Customers
The Developer must give due consideration to the identification of a Vulnerable Customer
and take any appropriate steps to help a Customer make informed decisions.
The Developer should take all reasonable steps so that arrangements are made to provide
Vulnerable Customers with appropriate advice and assistance suitable to their needs, and that
employees do not make assumptions about the degree of knowledge that a Customer has.
If no Vulnerability is declared by a Customer, but it becomes apparent that there may
be a Vulnerability, the Developer must seek clarification from that person and/or their
representative. Enquiries must be of a nature that are considerate, inoffensive and
non-discriminatory.
1.6 Customer service standards and training
The Developer must ensure that they have systems and procedures, including any consent
to data sharing where required, in place to enable them to accurately and reliably meet their
commitments to compliance, service requirements, processes/procedures, no high-pressure
selling, considering Vulnerable Customers, information disclosure/recording and monitoring
in relation to the Code.
Information about such compliance to the Code may be requested by the New Homes Quality
Board Compliance and Data Team as required from time to time and the Developer must
agree to comply with all such Requirements in a timely manner.
The Developer must provide training on the Code Requirements to all employees who deal
with Customers. In addition, any Agents used by the Developer must be required to ensure
that they are familiar with and meet Code Requirements.
1.7 Legal and other advisers, commission and inducements for goods and services
The Developer must make Customers aware that they should seek and appoint independent
legal advice when carrying out the legal formalities of buying the New Home.
The Developer may offer to recommend to a Customer the services of a Professional Adviser,
however, the Developer must not restrict a Customer's choice of Professional Adviser to one
of those which is recommended by the Developer. This includes legal representative,
Pre-Completion Inspector, financial adviser or mortgage intermediary. The Developer cannot
offer or link any inducement or incentives when recommending any such services.
Where a Customer is enquiring in a non-face-to-face situation directly to a Developer (e.g., via
website, portal, App, etc.) about a New Home, and this includes a link to the services of a specific
Professional Adviser (e.g., legal representative, financial adviser or mortgage intermediary),
including for a mortgage qualification or calculation provided by a specific third party, the
Developer must clearly identify the specific third-party provider and obtain Customer consent.
The Developer must notify a Customer at the time of referral (for services), or Reservation/
purchase (for goods) if they (the Developer) receive any fee, commission or any other reward or
advantage for introducing any Professional Adviser or for recommending to a Customer certain
products or services.
Part One: Selling a new home



PART TWO:
LEGAL DOCUMENTS,
INFORMATION, INSPECTION
AND COMPLETION
There are a number of stages in the purchase of a New Home. These can include:
a) an opportunity to secure a particular plot early, also called an Early Bird or plot option
arrangement (see section 2.1).
b) a Reservation Agreement, which is a contract between a Customer and the Developer.
where a home is reserved for purchase and is then subject to the completion of formal legal
documents (see sections 2.2-2.5).
c) pre-completion information, where specific information about the proposed purchase is
made available to a Customer or their legal adviser by the Developer (see section 2.6).
d) the Contract of Sale, which is the formal legal document committing both parties to
complete a sale, other than in exceptional circumstances (see section 2.7).
e) Notice of the Completion Date, which is the formal notice informing a Customer that the
New Home will be ready for Legal Completion and occupation from a specific date (see
section 2.7a).
f) An opportunity for the Customer to visit a New Home before Legal Completion. In addition,
a customer can arrange for a suitably qualified inspector to carry out a Pre-Completion
Inspection, using the Template Pre-Completion Inspection Checklist before the Legal
Completion date (see section 2.8).
g) Legal Completion, which is when the home ownership is transferred from the Developer
to a Customer and the New Home can be occupied by a Customer (see section 2.11).
This section of the Code sets out Requirements and expectations in relation to these steps.
2.1 Early bird arrangements
A Developer may offer a Customer an option to be notified and then to secure, by way of an
exclusive pre-release for a period of time, the choice of a plot or plots within a Development.
This is sometimes known as an Early Bird or option arrangement.
A Developer may charge a Customer a fee for such arrangement provided that:
a) the maximum amount which may be charged for an Early Bird arrangement is £150, or such
other amount set by the New Homes Quality Board from time to time.
b) the Developer makes it clear to a Customer before the fee is paid the period of time for
which such exclusivity arrangement will be open for acceptance, as well as the basis on
which such fee is refundable.
Part Two: Legal documents, information, inspection and completion
If the Developer takes a fee or payment then the full fee must be refunded to a Customer
if they advise the Developer they do not wish to proceed with the purchase within a minimum
of 24 hours (or such later time as the Developer specified at the time of the fee becoming
payable) of a Customer being notified of the plot being released for sale.
If 24 hours (or such later time where applicable) has elapsed since a Customer has been
notified by the Developer of the release of the plot for sale then the Developer may make
a deduction for administration costs providing the basis for any deduction has been clearly
explained to a Customer at the point of payment.
A Customer's rights and expectations regarding such Early Bird arrangements may not diminish
or reduce the provisions set out in this Code regarding all other documentation and
information provisions under this Part Two.
2.2 Reservation Agreements
Where a Customer wishes to reserve a New Home, this must be done by a formal Reservation
Agreement between a Customer and the Developer.
A Reservation Agreement should not be entered into until all the material facts relevant to the
purchase / sale are available to all parties.
The Developer must ensure that the Reservation Agreement terms and conditions are clear,
fair and written in plain language and comply with all relevant legislation.
The Developer must give a Customer a copy of the Reservation Agreement that has been
signed by both parties (digitally or otherwise) and which sets out clearly the terms of the
Reservation.
Terms of the Reservation must include, but are not limited to:
a) the Developer must be clear about who a Customer is buying their New Home from.
b) the amount of the Reservation Fee.
c) a Customer's right to cancel within the Reservation period and the range (in monetary terms)
of any possible cost retention.
d) the terms under which the Reservation Fee is refundable and non-refundable and any
administration fees or similar which the Developer may deduct.
e) that there is a mandatory 14 calendar day Cooling Off Period where the agreement may
be cancelled and the Reservation Fee will be refunded without deduction and in full.
f) how to make a cancellation of the Reservation Agreement, including as a result of a Major
Change (as set out in Part 2.9).
g) that it is "Subject to Contract” (England & Wales only).
h) details of the New Home including property type, plot number, Development name, postal
address (if available), parking arrangements.
i) the purchase price of the New Home.
j) how long the price and the Reservation Agreement remain valid.
k) how and when the Reservation Agreement will end.
1) contact details for the relevant New Home Warranty provider together with a summary
document of the New Home Warranty cover obtained by the Developer from the New
Home Warranty provider.
m) date by which Contract Exchange must take place, which should be reasonable in the
circumstances of the transaction, taking into account when all the information listed in 2.6
is provided and in any event not less than six weeks after Reservation unless the Customer
requests an earlier date.
Part Two: Legal documents, information, inspection and completion
n) any dependent or conditional matters for example part-exchange details, if applicable.
o) details of how a Customer can include in the Contract of Sale any spoken statement that
is to be relied upon.
p) the nature and annual estimated cost of any Management Services, or in Scotland,
Factoring Costs, together with other costs that a Customer must pay.
q) the New Home tenure e.g., Leasehold, Freehold, Commonhold, etc. and all associated
costs including the basis of future changes to costs relating to the tenure.
r) the nature and method of assessment of any Event Fees.
s) scope and process for administering changes to the New Home (i.e., paint colour, design
changes, specification changes).
In relation to anticipated costs, the Developer must also provide an Affordability Schedule
which is a reasonable identification of likely costs directly associated with the tenure and
management of the New Home, of which the Developer can reasonably be expected to be
aware, to cover a period of 10 years.
The Affordability Schedule must include:
a) details of any ground rent, including amount, payment dates and applicable formula.
b) estimated amounts, of "known” and/or “anticipated” additional costs deriving directly from
the tenure of the sale such as Management Services fees (e.g., maintenance of landscaping,
highways that are not adopted by local authorities, etc), Event Fees and/or other charges.
This should highlight for attention of a Customer any stepped service charges in later years
as additional facilities become available or sinking fund charges for repairs or maintenance
may be introduced. Where the value of actual costs or charges are unknown the Developer
should provide a Customer with an un-costed schedule of items.
c) details of known or anticipated costs or charges for regular maintenance of integral plant
and equipment, e.g., communal heating, grey water harvesting, air source heat pumps, etc.
where these are not already accounted for in Management Services fees or Event (e.g.,
Change of Circumstances) Fees. Where the value of actual costs or charges are unknown
the Developer should provide a Customer with an un-costed schedule of items.
d) Estimated costs for maintaining the property (e.g., painting render, etc) and repairing/
replacing any fixtures or appliances as required during the first 10 years.
2.3 Cooling off period
All Reservation Agreements must include a minimum 'Cooling Off' period of 14 calendar days,
during which the Reservation Fee must be refunded in full if a Customer wishes to cancel the
Reservation for any reason.
2.4 Cancellation after the cooling off period
The Reservation Agreement may set out deductions which will apply to a cancellation of the
Reservation Agreement where a cancellation occurs after the Cooling Off Period.
The Reservation Fee less any advised deductions, must be refunded by the Developer within
14 calendar days of the date of notice of cancellation given by a Customer.
Part Two: Legal documents, information, inspection and completion
2.5 Cancellation by the Developer
While the Reservation Agreement remains valid, the Developer does not have the right to
terminate the Reservation Agreement and must not enter into a new Reservation Agreement
or sale agreement with another Customer on the same New Home.
On completion of the Reservation Agreement the Developer must provide the Home Warranty
Provider with full details of the property reserved and a Customer's contact details.
2.6 Pre-contract of Sale
The Developer must give a Customer's legal adviser suitable and relevant information to help
the Customer to make fully informed purchasing decisions and take appropriate advice.
In all cases this information must include (i) information in relation to the property and
planning matters and (ii) the actual and anticipated costs associated with the property.
More specifically as follows:
a) in relation to the property and planning:
i. a written Reservation Agreement.
ii. a summary of the cover provided by the New Home Warranty and contact details of the
relevant Home Warranty Provider.
iii. the tenure of the New Home e.g., Leasehold, Freehold, Commonhold, etc.
iv. the Detailed Planning Consent reference number under which the New Home is being
constructed and, where known and for which there is Planning Consent, details of any
known future build phases by the Developer, any facilities which the Developer is party to
on the Development.
v. a list of contents in the New Home which are included in the price including, but not limited
to, white goods, curtains, carpeting, wall tiling, door entry systems, power points and
sanitary-ware fittings.
vi. confirmation of the advertised/marketed specification of the New Home including the type
of materials providing the main structural frame of the building (masonry, timber, steel frame
or other).
vii. information relating to the standards to which the New Home is being built, including
confirmation that it will be built in compliance with the applicable Building Regulations,
the relevant Home Warranty Provider's standards and manufacturers / supplier's
performance and installation standards.
viii.any exceptional restrictions around use of, occupancy or appearance of the New Home and
the curtilage. This does not include standard terms covered in the title deeds, plot transfer
of ownership, or equivalent document. The Developer must direct a Customer to a
Customer's legal adviser to obtain advice on any such restrictions.
ix. details of any services, facilities and/or liabilities which may not immediately transfer
to a Customer on Legal Completion and are temporarily retained by the Developer.
Where these transfer to a Customer at a later date then this must be fully explained
and documented e.g., drainage systems, utilities, etc.
Part Two: Legal documents, information, inspection and completion
b) in relation to actual and anticipated costs
i. a description of any Management Services and organisations to which a Customer will be
committed.
ii. an Indicative Costs Schedule which is a reasonable identification of likely costs directly
associated with the tenure and management of the New Home, of which the Developer can
reasonably be expected to be aware, to cover a period of 10 years. This includes any obligation
to contribute towards maintenance and/or replacement of services and facilities and does not
include everyday maintenance and replacement costs relating to a home, such as internal
systems, equipment and appliances, or utilities. The Indicative Costs Schedule must reiterate:
• details of any ground rent, including amount, payment dates and applicable formula.
•
estimated amounts, of “known” and/or “anticipated” additional costs deriving directly from
the tenure of the sale such as Management Services fees, Event Fees, and/or other charges.
This should highlight for attention of a Customer any stepped service charges in later years
as additional facilities become available or sinking fund charges for repairs or maintenance
may be introduced. Where the value of actual costs or charges are unknown the Developer
should provide a Customer with an un-costed schedule of items.
• details of known or anticipated costs or charges for regular maintenance of integral plant
and equipment, e.g., communal heating, grey water harvesting, air source heat pumps, etc.
where these are not already accounted for in Management Services fees or Event (e.g.,
Change of Circumstances) Fees. Where the value of actual costs or charges are unknown the
Developer should provide a Customer with an un-costed schedule of items.
iii. The Developer is not required to inform a Customer of the value of normal costs and charges
associated with owning the New Home e.g., utilities, energy bills, council tax, home insurances.
A Customer should make separate enquiries of these and take steps to consider the overall
affordability of the New Home, taking into account information about additional and
anticipated costs relating to the New Home.
iv. The Indicative Costs Schedule does not need to set out estimated possible costs which will
arise and depend on decisions of a Management or Service Company that fall outside the
scope of necessary costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of the New Home,
including any facilities. However, the extent of any such landholdings and obligations must be
set out clearly, for example where it extends to street lighting, parks, landscaping or other
such matters.
If the New Home is not yet complete, then the Developer must also provide a Customer with:
a) the Anticipated Completion Date, the Developer's provisional estimate of when the New Home
will be ready for occupation.
b) a brochure or plan illustrating the size, specification, general layout and plot position and
orientation of the New Home. Details of any significant gradients to the garden and grounds of
the New Home must be provided to a Customer together with information on how the surfaces
and any fences and or boundary walls will be finished. All outbuildings and garages should be
clearly marked and include details of finishes and construction if different to the New Home
structure.
The Developer must inform a Customer and their legal advisers, in writing, how their questions will
be addressed and who to contact (with names and contact numbers) during the sale, purchase
and transfer of ownership of the New Home to a Customer.
The Developer agrees to keep Customers informed about any known or any anticipated additional
costs that may arise for the New Home (so far as is reasonably possible) as well as any known
restrictions on provision of services and service providers, including by reason of connected party
providers, for gas, electricity, broadband, water, sewerage or other standard utility.
Part Two: Legal documents, information, inspection and completion
2.7 Contract of sale
The Developer must ensure that the Contract of Sale terms and conditions are clear, fair,
and written in plain language and comply with all relevant legislation. In addition it must:
a) define the Legal Completion Notice Period that is from serving of the Notice to Complete
to Legal Completion.
b) clearly state the circumstances in which a Customer can terminate the Contract of Sale.
c) clearly state what will happen if construction of the New Home is delayed and the New
Home will not be ready for ownership by a Customer by the date advised by the
Developer.
d) clearly explain how Contract Deposits are to be protected.
e) make suitable provisions to provide a two-year builders liability period for a Customer. This
also applies to Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and other short-term trading arrangements
which may be formed to construct a specific New Home or Development.
To avoid Disputes over spoken statements, immediately before Contract Exchange, the
Developer should ensure that a Customer, through their legal representative, states in writing
what spoken statements they are relying on when entering into the Contract of Sale.
2.8 Keeping the Customer informed and Pre-Completion Inspection checks
The Developer must provide an opportunity for the Customer to visit the New Home and/or
appoint a suitably qualified inspector to complete the Template Pre-Completion Inspection
Checklist on their behalf, to be carried out before completion and from 5 calendar days
(earlier by mutual agreement) after the Notice to Complete has been served. For the absence
of doubt, the Template Pre-Completion Inspection Checklist is the only checklist that may be
used for the Pre-Completion Inspection.
In setting the Legal Completion Notice Period, in order to provide sufficient Notice to
Complete all legal Requirements and provide the opportunity for the Pre-Completion
Inspection to be carried out this would usually be expected to be a period of no less than 14
calendar days (unless otherwise agreed between the Developer and the Customer). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Completion Inspection Checklist does not operate to delay or
prevent Legal Completion in line with the Notice to Complete but does require the Developer
to respond in line with the provisions set out in Part 3.
The Developer should explain the process for keeping the Customer updated about the
timetable for the likely completion of the New Home and provide timely updates to the
Customer.
The Developer must ensure that their sites comply with all relevant health and safety
legislation and guidance appropriate to visitors.
The Developer must inform Customers about the health and safety precautions they, or their
representative must take if and when permitted to visit a live construction site. The Developer
can refuse access to a live construction site to the Customer or any representative, inspector
or professional acting on their behalf if health and safety precautions required by the
Developer are not adhered to.
Part Two: Legal documents, information, inspection and completion
2.9 Changes, agreement to substantial changes, and termination of contract for
unacceptable changes
The Developer must advise a Customer of the Customers' right to terminate the Reservation
Agreement and Contract of Sale and the specific circumstances when they could exercise it.
The Developer must notify a Customer in writing of a Major Change which occurs after
the Reservation Agreement is entered into. A Major Change is a change that alters the size,
appearance or value of the New Home (including the internal layout) from what was shown
to a Customer in the Reservation Agreement and/or Contract of Sale (as applicable).
The Developer should inform a Customer to seek advice from their Professional Adviser.
If these Major Changes are unacceptable to a Customer, the Customer has the right to
terminate the Reservation Agreement or Contract of Sale (as applicable) and be refunded their
Contract Deposit, Reservation Fee and any other pre-payments without deductions provided
that the Customer exercises such a right of termination no later than 14 calendar days after
such notification of a Major Change. For the avoidance of doubt, no Notice to Complete may
be served during such 14-calendar day period.
The Developer is expected to keep the Customer informed of changes to the design,
construction or materials of the New Home which are not Major Changes. Such changes
(where they are not Major Changes) do not give a Customer the right to cancel the Reservation
Agreement or Contract of Sale and a Customer's formal agreement to them is not required but
the Customer retains all rights with respect to Snags and Complaints in respect of such
changes where these have not been agreed by them.
If the Developer has agreed to do additional works for a Customer which will change the
timescale for completing the New Home, an extension of time may be required for the
Anticipated Completion Date, and other amendments made to the Reservation Agreement
and/or Contract of Sale, and the provisions of this Code shall be interpreted accordingly to
take account of such agreed additional works. Customers should be notified to take legal
advice in relation to any such additional works and in relation to any contractual changes
required.
In Scotland, the Developer must comply with Requirements to ensure that materials
substituted still comply with the relevant building warrant. Nothing in this section relating to
discussions with the customer displaces any such legal obligation.
2.10 Complete new home
Legal Completion can only take place on a Complete New Home which complies with Building
Regulations and all applicable building safety Requirements for safe occupation. It is a breach of this
Code for Legal Completion to take place on a New Home that is not a Complete New Home.
A Complete New Home is one that has a New Home Warranty cover note issued in relation to it,
and in each case;
Either in relation to a house,
may be considered complete if all rooms, spaces and facilities are in a finished condition for the
purpose for which they are designed and intended and the property provides safe entrance and

disruption or inconvenience to rectify or complete.
AND, in each case
in relation to Scotland only, where the local authority has provided confirmation that the home
can be occupied (Habitation Certificate) has been obtained.
The Developer must not offer a Customer incentive (financial or otherwise) to move into,
or complete the purchase of, a New Home that is not a Complete New Home.
2.11 Legal completion

j) provide the Building Regulation Completion Certificate (Habitation Certificate) where
available, and where not yet available, advise a Customer that the Building Regulation
Completion Certificate will not be available until after Legal Completion, for example for
apartments until the whole apartment Development is completed.
2.12 Incomplete and ancillary works
At Legal Completion the Developer must provide a Customer with a statement of incomplete
works as part of the Development under the relevant Planning Consent, and indicative
timescales for their completion. This applies to, for example, roads, open spaces, recreational
areas and landscaping. The Developer should ensure that the Customer is kept informed of
progress in fulfilling commitments in the relevant Planning Consent.
The Developer must advise a Customer of known future phases of work on the Development
committed to by the Developer. As construction work is undertaken, the Developer should
identify and consider reasonable steps to mitigate any significant adverse impact on the
Customer.

Part Two: Legal documents, information, inspection and completion



PART THREE:
AFTER-SALES, COMPLAINTS
MANAGEMENT AND A
NEW HOMES OMBUDSMAN
Obligations in respect of a New Home do not end at the point of sale and occupation.
Developers are required to provide continuing After-Sales Service and a Complaints
Resolution process in line with the Requirements and expectations of this Code.
The Code requires that the Complaints process and escalation to a New Homes Ombudsman
Service is available to the Customer for two years from the date of Reservation or Legal
Completion, whichever is later. Where Developers elect to outsource their After-Sales Service
to a third party, the responsibility for providing this service and complying with the
requirements of this Code still lie with the Developer.
Any individual scheme put in place by a Developer must still adhere to the Requirements of
the Code, including the Complaints process and the ability for the Customer to refer issues
to a New Homes Ombudsman Service.
3.1 After-sales service
The Developer must provide a Customer of the New Home with a comprehensive and accessible
After-Sales Service for a minimum of two years following the date of Legal Completion.
To make sure a Customer understands how to access the After-Sales Service, the Developer
must provide a Customer with suitable information about the service which must include:
a) a clear written statement of their After-Sales Service procedures.
b) an explanation of their responsibility for remedying any issues or problems (including Snags
and/or Defects) arising in the property during the first two years, and that the Customer
should identify any issues or problems (including Snags and/or Defects) and report them
to the Developer promptly in order for the Developer to meet their responsibilities.
c) an explanation of how issues or problems and service calls will be managed, including
timescales; how they should be reported and the names and contact information of the
Developer's staff to whom such issues should be reported and notified to.
d) allowing the Customer the option to categorise any issue or problem (including Snags and/or
Defects) as a formal Complaint if they are unhappy with the Developers proposed approach.
e) an explanation of the process for reporting and handling Emergency Issues including clarity
on what qualifies as an Emergency Issue and how the Developer will deal with them. This
must include issues relating to health and safety that could materially impact on health and
wellbeing or cause injury or loss of life.
f) clear guidance on what the Customer might expect to constitute normal maintenance and
"running in" which is a Customer's responsibility.
The Developer must tell Customers about the health and safety precautions they must take when
living on a Development where building work continues and the measures which the Developer
implements in order to protect them.
3.2 After sales issues and complaints management
The Developer must have a system and procedures for receiving, handling and resolving issues
or problems raised by the Customer for its After-Sale Service, as well as Complaints in line with
the Requirements, including time periods, set out in the Code.
Part Three: After-sales, complaints management and the New Homes Ombudsman
The Developer must provide a Customer with a written statement of the process for raising an
issue or problem in its After-Sale Service, as well as the process for making a formal Complaint
to the Developer. Such written statement may be provided by letter, brochure/leaflet,
electronically (email) or clearly visible on a Developer's website.
Information provided to Customer must include details of how a Customer can escalate the
Complaint or Dispute to a New Homes Ombudsman Service if the Developer and a Customer
fail to agree on the resolution.
The Code requires that the Complaints process and escalation to a New Homes Ombudsman
Service is available to the Customer for two years from the date of Reservation or Legal
Completion, whichever is later.
The Developer must co-operate with any appropriately qualified Professional Adviser appointed
by a Customer to help resolve Complaints before they become a Dispute. Subject to compliance
with data, confidentiality or health and safety processes, the Developer must provide the same
level of co-operation to an intermediary authorised by a Customer to represent a Customer
(e.g., a family member, friend or Professional Adviser) as they would to a Customer.
3.3 Snagging period and resolution of Snagging issues
It is widely acknowledged that there are some finishing or other issues which need addressing
on moving into a New Home and these are commonly known as “Snags” and "Snagging".
Developers are expected to work collaboratively with their Customers around identification,
access and resolution of Snagging following Legal Completion.
The Developer must ensure that Snags are covered by the After-Sales Service and that once
agreed, they are resolved promptly.
Any Snags, Issues or problems raised through the After-Sales Service process must be
acknowledged promptly. It is expected that in most situations a Developer should be able
to resolve an After-Sales issue or problem within 30 calendar days, other than where there is
a substantial reason for delay. Where there is such a delay, the reasons for that should be
communicated clearly to the Customer, with no less than monthly updates provided until the
matter is resolved. If a Customer is dissatisfied with the After Sales Service a Complaint may
be made under the formal Complaints Process of that Developer.
For the avoidance of doubt, Emergency Issues are not Snags and, if not resolved
satisfactorily, a Customer can make a Complaint about such Emergency Issues from the date
of Legal Completion.
Part Three: After-sales, complaints management and the New Homes Ombudsman
3.4 Complaints process
If a Customer is dissatisfied with the resolution of an issue or problem raised through:
Part One: Selling a New Home
Part Two: Legal Documents, Information, Inspection and Completion
Part Three: After-Sales
a Complaint may be made in accordance with the Developer's Complaints Process.
It is a Requirement that the Developer's Complaints procedures must include the following
mandated minimum steps from the date of the first Complaint:
a) Written Acknowledgment: no later than 5 calendar days from the first business day after
the Complaint is received (the Complaint Initiation Date), the Developer will send a written
acknowledgment of the Complaint to a Customer).
b) Path to Resolution Letter: no later than 10 calendar days from the Complaint Initiation
Date, the Developer will provide, a written Path to Resolution which outlines to a Customer
how the Developer will investigate the Complaint. This will include notifying a Customer if
the Complaint may be subject to a resolution service.
c) Complaint Assessment and Response Letter: no later than 30 calendar days from the
Complaint Initiation Date, a Customer will be sent a Complaint Assessment and Response
Letter from the Developer.
The Complaint Assessment and Response letter must include the following information:
each Complaint is to be separately identified and reported upon.
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
V.
vi.
vii.
where a Complaint has been resolved, what action has been taken to do so.
if not resolved but further time is needed to look into the matter, the estimated time
within which a decision will be reached together with a brief explanation as what
further steps are required and why.
if not resolved but remediation work is accepted, what that work will be and an
estimated time within which required work will be completed.
where further investigations or remediation has been set out in the letter, when the
next update will be provided, which must not be more than 28 calendar days.
where a Complaint is not accepted, that is to be set out clearly with a clear
explanation for the decision.
information about any recommended engagement with any applicable resolution
service.
viii. information about how to refer matters to a New Homes Ombudsman Service.
d) Eight week (56 day) Letter: where the complaint is not closed and no later than 56
calendar days from the Complaint Initiation Date, a Customer will be sent an Eight Week
Letter from the Developer.
Part Three: After-sales, complaints management and the New Homes Ombudsman
The Eight Week Letter must include the following information:
i.
a clear summary of what action has been taken to date.
ii. clear details of what is still outstanding, a reason why and the actions to be taken.
iii. an indicative timescale for resolution.
iv. the frequency that updates will be provided to the Customer by the Developer until
resolution, which must not be more than 28 calendar days.
e) Closure Letter: to be sent by the Developer to the Customer at any stage following the
Complaint Initiation Date
The letter must include:
i.
a list of the items agreed in the Complaint Assessment and Response letter and
ii.
confirmation that each item has been resolved.
information about how to refer matters to a New Homes Ombudsman Service.
For the avoidance of doubt, a Developer may choose to aggregate a number of Complaints
into a single Complaint, provided that the timetable shall apply from the first such
Complaint received.
3.5 Referrals to a New Homes Ombudsman Service (NHOS)
If Defects complained of or Snags reported are not resolved in accordance with the timetables
and procedure required by the Complaints Process, then a Customer may refer a Dispute to a
New Homes Ombudsman Service. It is within a New Homes Ombudsman Service's discretion
to decide when or if to accept a referral to it, in accordance with a New Homes Ombudsman
Service's scheme rules.
In line with established consumer best practice, a Customer can refer a Complaint that arose
within the first two years to a New Homes Ombudsman Service after 56 calendar days of the
Complaint Initiation Date, whether or not the date which the customer refers the Complaint
to a New Homes Ombudsman Service is within the first two years after Legal Completion.
Any complaint should always be made promptly by a Customer. It is within a New Homes
Ombudsman Service's discretion to decide when or if to accept a referral to it, in accordance
with a New Homes Ombudsman Service's scheme rules.
The Developer must co-operate with any request from a New Homes Ombudsman Service
to provide all relevant information where a Customer has asked a Complaint to be reviewed.
3.6 Re-sale
In relation to second and subsequent Customers of the New Home this Code applies only in
respect of After-Sales matters reported within two years of the date of the Legal Completion of
the original New Home purchase and legal advice in respect of a subsequent sale should be
sought accordingly.
Part Three: After-sales, complaints management and the New Homes Ombudsman




PART FOUR:
SOLVENCY, LEGAL AND
JURISDICTION
The Developer must ensure that the contractual party as Developer and Seller
(if different from the Developer, for example a special purpose vehicle) is
financially adequately established or insured so as to provide reasonable
protection against insolvency and the capacity to meet its obligations under
the Code, including timely repayment of financial deposits when due and any
financial awards made by the Ombudsman.
Nothing contained within this Code affects a Customer's existing legal or statutory
rights and does not replace any legislation applying to the New Home. Customers do
not have to make a Complaint to a New Homes Ombudsman Service for matters which
are covered by the Code, they may decide to pursue an alternative course of action,
such as through the civil courts or other applicable ombudsman or regulator.
References to 'a Customer' mean one or more Customers as applicable where the
New Homes is jointly purchased.
