- Inspection process failures
- Moisture accumulation risks
- Structural timber protection adequacy
- Correction attempt verification

3.1.3 **Sewer Gas Contamination Risk**
Sewer gas risk created through soil vent pipe terminating open-ended within loft space rather than proper connection to ventilation system per Building Regulations Part H. This critical failure requires:
- Installation procedure investigation
- Inspection sign-off review
- Health risk assessment completion
- Remediation verification procedures
- Liability implications analysis
- Similar installation pattern review

3.1.4 **Vermin Access Facilitation**
Vermin access documented through unsealed roof void with gaps exceeding 4mm maximum per NHBC Chapter 7.2.19 with evidence of active infestation discovered. Investigation requirements:

- Photographic evidence
- Independent contractor verification
- Drone survey confirmation
Investigation required into communication accuracy and verification procedures

4.1.2 **Property Inspection Claims**
Multiple property inspections were claimed including "approximately 15 checks" plus Stage 12 inspection. Extensive defects remained unidentified. Investigation needed regarding:
- Inspection procedure documentation
- Competence of inspection personnel

4.1.6 **Competence Admission**
Build manager claimed approximately 15 property checks had been conducted while simultaneously admitting customer possessed superior knowledge of NHBC standards than himself, raising fundamental questions about:
- Inspection competence adequacy
- Quality control validity
- Training requirements
- Supervision effectiveness
- Systemic competence issues

## 5. THE NHBC APPROVAL CONTRADICTION REQUIRING URGENT CLARIFICATION

### 5.1 The Fundamental Contradiction

Crest Nicholson has formally stated in written correspondence that NHBC approved and signed off the property including specific non-compliant elements. This position requires immediate investigation as it implies either:
- NHBC knowingly approved violations of their own standards, or
- Misrepresentation of NHBC position has occurred

### 5.2 Specific Approval Claims Requiring Verification

The following non-compliant elements allegedly received NHBC approval:
- 70mm garage DPC installation (less than 50% of required 150mm)
- Walls exceeding 6000mm without movement joints
- Open soil vent pipe termination in habitable space
- Unsealed roof voids with gaps exceeding 4mm
- Buried air brick installation preventing ventilation

### 5.3 Documentation Requirements

To resolve this contradiction, provision required of:
- Complete NHBC approval documentation for specific non-compliant installations
- Technical justification for standard deviations
- NHBC inspector identification and qualification verification
- Special dispensation documentation if granted
- Variation request documentation if submitted
- Post-inspection NHBC review documentation

### 5.4 Implications of Approval Claims

If NHBC approved documented violations, investigation required into:
- Certification system integrity
- Warranty protection validity
- Consumer reliance on NHBC standards
- Industry-wide implications
- Regulatory notification requirements
- Insurance coverage questions

### 5.5 Systemic Investigation Requirements

This contradiction necessitates investigation of:
- Information provided to NHBC during inspections
