# Weber Render Manufacturer - Critical Warnings About Movement Joint Installation

## Summary
Weber, the render manufacturer used on 10 Colt View, has provided professional warnings that the NHOS-mandated remediation work will cause catastrophic damage to the property.

## Weber's Exact Warnings

### Direct Quotes from Weber Technical Team:

1. **"removing render especially bonded render is never a good choice, yes its very messy, very disruptive and very noisy"**

2. **"the face of the outer leaf will undoubtable be destroyed"** 
   - This refers to the blockwork face when render is removed using mechanical tools

3. **"more harm than good"**
   - Weber's assessment of what cutting in movement joints would achieve

4. **"as a last resort"**
   - Weber states render removal should only be done in extreme circumstances

## Context

- **Date of Weber Communication**: November 2024 (referenced in NHOS correspondence)
- **Reason for Contact**: To assess feasibility of cutting movement joints into existing render
- **Weber's Position**: The render has absorbed into the blockwork, making removal inherently destructive

## Implications

1. **NHOS Mandate**: Orders work that the manufacturer says will "destroy" the property
2. **Technical Impossibility**: Cannot comply with NHOS order without causing massive damage
3. **Manufacturer Liability**: Weber explicitly warns against the proposed remediation
4. **Property Value**: Work would significantly damage the property's structural integrity

## Key Point
The regulator (NHOS) has mandated remediation work that the product manufacturer (Weber) explicitly states should "never be done" and will "undoubtably destroy" parts of the building.

This creates an impossible situation where:
- Compliance with NHOS order = destruction of property
- Non-compliance = breach of regulatory order
- Either option causes harm to the homeowner
