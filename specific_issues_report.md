Thank you for your email and for providing the picture.  We have actioned the required works to the block that was slightly higher, however, as you are aware, a garage is not built as a watertight build, and you may find some water ingress following heavy rain.  This is not deemed as a defect, and we will be taking no further action.  You can add a weather bar to the foot of the garage to assist with rain and debris blowing in which can be purchased from any good DIY/tool store as the garage door is also not a sealed unit.

  1.  It was agreed by Adrian Sims that we could take our garage personnel doors as these were purchased by ourselves (it was preferred by Crest to leave a tidy hole in the garage wall than have doors installed in plot 34).  The company can not be booked until we have a moving day, at which point they can confirm if they are available to remove them and fit them in the new property.  This was discussed with the site and sales team a number of times. I would advise, to have the garage personal door removed, whilst you are in your current home and have them refitted once you have completed on 34 Albany Road.
