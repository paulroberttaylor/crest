# Email to Steve Wood - NHBC

**Subject:** Re: NHBC Reference 25/20019 - 2014 Standards Used on 2022/2023 Build

Good morning Mr Wood,

Crest Nicholson has admitted to the NHOS that 2014 NHBC standards were used to construct my property at 10 Colt View, Albany Wood, Bishops Waltham, built late 2022/early 2023.

I would like an official response from the NHBC why Crest would be allowed to use almost a decade old standard when there were up to date standards in place. I am particularly concerned as 9 years of safety improvements and building practice updates have been ignored.

Please confirm:
1. Whether NHBC permits builders to use outdated standards when current standards exist
2. Which version of NHBC standards should apply to properties built in 2022/2023
3. Details of any NHBC final inspection sign-off for this property

I would also be grateful for a response to Crest's claim to me that the house was signed off by the NHBC. The house, as confirmed by a third party surveyor engaged by Crest, should have had movement joints in 2 different elevations due to length. If the NHBC signed the house off with this issue, according to Crest, I'd like to know why I had to fight Crest for 18 months to get to the point where this was confirmed, although still not admitted by Crest, who continue to refer to it as cosmetic, unnecessary, and the rectification of it, a gesture of goodwill.

Please provide copies of any NHBC inspection reports or sign-off documentation for my property.

I await your response.

Kind regards,
Paul Taylor
