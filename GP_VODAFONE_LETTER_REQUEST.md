# GP Letter Request - For Vodafone

## Purpose
I need a letter to support my request to Vodafone for removal of a credit default (Â£156) that occurred during a severe personal crisis. The default has been paid in full immediately upon discovery.

## Key Points to Confirm

### Timeline
- Ongoing housing crisis since 2021 (4 years)
- Two successive defective properties from same builder
- Culminated in acute crisis requiring medical intervention July 2025
- Prescribed antidepressants and sleeping tablets on [date]

### Impact on Family
- Significant stress on entire family unit
- Particular impact on our son
- Wife also affected while managing her parents' dementia
- Prolonged nature has caused cumulative harm

### Medical Assessment
- Confirmation that the housing situation has directly impacted mental health
- The prolonged stress led to the acute episode in July 2025
- During such crisis periods, administrative oversights are understandable
- Current medication and treatment plan

### Professional Opinion
- That missing a small financial obligation during this crisis is consistent with the documented stress levels
- The immediate payment upon discovery demonstrates good faith
- The ongoing housing situation continues to impact the family's wellbeing

## Context (for GP's information only)
- The default prevents mortgage flexibility needed to escape the current property
- New Homes Ombudsman has confirmed our property has major defects
- Builder used outdated 2014 standards on 2023 build
- Without default removal, family remains trapped in harmful situation

## Suggested Format
- NHS letterhead
- Brief, factual confirmation of timeline and impact
- Professional assessment of how crisis could lead to administrative oversight
- No need for extensive detail - Vodafone just needs medical confirmation

Thank you for your support in helping our family escape this damaging situation.
