# Vodafone Default Removal - Goodwill Request

**Subject: Goodwill Request - Account Settled due to Exceptional Hardship - Account [Your Account Number]**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request the removal of a default for £156.08 from my credit file as a gesture of goodwill.

Upon discovering this default—which I was genuinely unaware of due to an extreme personal crisis—I immediately settled the account in full. The balance was paid to CCS Collections on [Date], reference 24662488.

Having now settled the debt, I am appealing to you on compassionate grounds. This small default is the only obstacle preventing my family from securing the mortgage flexibility we urgently need to escape a deeply harmful housing situation and sever all ties with the builder responsible.

**Summary of Exceptional Circumstances:**

The oversight on this account occurred for the following severe and documented reasons:

• **A Prolonged Housing Crisis:** My family has been trapped in a four-year dispute involving two successive defective new-build homes from the same builder. The issues with the first property were so severe that the resolution required me to sign a legally binding confidentiality agreement (NDA). My GP can confirm the full duration and devastating impact this has had on our family's health since 2021.

• **A Severe Medical Crisis:** The cumulative stress of this multi-year ordeal led to a personal breakdown, requiring an emergency GP appointment where I was prescribed medication for depression and sleep.

• **Regulatory Confirmation & Builder Misconduct:** The New Homes Ombudsman (Case: NHOS-2024-000512) has formally upheld our complaint regarding our current home, confirming serious structural defects requiring weeks of remediation. Critically, their investigation confirmed that the builder wrongly used 2014 standards instead of the required 2022 standards—a nine-year discrepancy. The NHBC have corroborated this in writing, confirming the 2022 standards were mandatory (email evidence enclosed).

**Request for Compassionate Consideration:**

This default is trapping my family—including our son—in what is now our second defective home from the same builder. After everything we cannot legally discuss about the first property, we find ourselves again in confirmed substandard conditions. The pressure on us is compounded by the fact that both of my wife's parents are living with dementia, placing our family under almost unbearable strain.

Given these truly extraordinary circumstances and my immediate settlement of the account, I implore you to act compassionately and remove this default from my credit file with all credit reference agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion).

This was never about avoiding payment—as evidenced by my immediate settlement upon discovery—but was purely an administrative oversight during a period of documented crisis. I hope Vodafone will recognize these exceptional circumstances and remove this barrier that is keeping my family trapped in mentally damaging conditions.

I look forward to your urgent and positive response.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Taylor
