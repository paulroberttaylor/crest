**Re: Urgent Request - Removal of Default Notice - Unknown Account**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in considerable distress after discovering that Vodafone has registered a default against my credit file. I have no knowledge of this account and do not recall having any services with Vodafone.

**The Situation:**
- I have discovered a default from Vodafone on my credit report
- I do not have, and to my knowledge have never had, a Vodafone account
- I cannot access any account as I have no account details
- Your live chat agents have advised I must visit a store, but I need urgent written resolution

**My Current Circumstances:**
I am currently in an extremely difficult situation with serious issues regarding my home that require financing options. This unexpected default is causing severe problems at the worst possible time. 

The stress of dealing with structural defects in our home for the past four years has severely impacted my mental health. Yesterday (July 15, 2025), I had an emergency GP appointment where I was prescribed antidepressants (Sertraline 100mg) and sleeping tablets. My doctor is preparing a letter documenting the severe stress my family and I have endured.

If I have somehow missed correspondence or payments during this crisis, I sincerely apologize - but I genuinely have no recollection of any Vodafone account.

**What I Need:**
1. Confirmation of what this default relates to
2. Details of the account in question
3. Evidence of any notices sent to me
4. **Most importantly - consideration for immediate removal of this default**

I am genuinely distressed by this situation. If there has been an error or mistaken identity, please remove this default immediately. If I have somehow missed something during our housing crisis, I am deeply sorry and will rectify any genuine debt immediately upon confirmation - but please, I beg you to remove the default so my family isn't trapped in our current situation.

**Next Steps:**
Please investigate this matter urgently and respond in writing. I am happy to provide any information needed to resolve this quickly. Given the serious impact on my family's wellbeing, I would be grateful for your compassion and swift action.

I can be contacted at the above address or via email at paulroberttaylor@gmail.com.

Thank you for your understanding and urgent attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

Paul Robert Taylor
