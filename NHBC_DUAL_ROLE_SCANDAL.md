# The NHBC Dual Role Scandal - Plot 34/10 Colt View

## Critical Discovery: NHBC Was Both Building Control AND Warranty Provider

### Winchester Building Control Confirmation
Winchester Building Control has confirmed that NHBC acted as the Building Control body for the Albany Wood development, including Plot 34/10 Colt View.

This means NHBC simultaneously held:
1. **Statutory Authority** - Legal duty to enforce Building Regulations
2. **Commercial Interest** - Warranty provider for the same properties

## The Catastrophic Conflict of Interest

### NHBC as Building Control
- **Legal Duty**: Enforce Building Regulations 2022
- **Criminal Liability**: Section 35 Building Act 1984 for failures
- **Statutory Inspections**: Required to verify compliance
- **Public Protection**: Duty to reject non-compliant work

### NHBC as Warranty Provider  
- **Commercial Interest**: Approve properties for warranty
- **Business Relationship**: With Crest Nicholson
- **Financial Incentive**: More approvals = more premiums
- **Liability**: For defects under warranty terms

## The Double Failure on Every Issue

### 1. Movement Joints (Required by ALL Standards)
- **Building Control Failure**: Didn't enforce requirement
- **Warranty Failure**: Didn't identify inevitable cracking
- **Result**: 18+ months of render failures

### 2. Air Brick Burial
- **Building Control Failure**: Missed critical ventilation violation  
- **Warranty Failure**: Didn't protect against damp risk
- **Result**: Customer found it, not NHBC

### 3. Garage DPC (70mm vs 150mm Required)
- **Building Control Failure**: Approved 53% below minimum
- **Warranty Failure**: Certified defective construction
- **Result**: Trinity Rose found it, not NHBC

### 4. Soil Vent Pipe Open in Loft
- **Building Control Failure**: Missed Part H violation
- **Warranty Failure**: Approved health hazard
- **Result**: Sewer gases in roof space

### 5. Roof Void Unsealed (Vermin Access)
- **Building Control Failure**: Missed 4mm gap requirement
- **Warranty Failure**: Certified despite infestation
- **Result**: Fly infestation discovered

## The 2014 Standards Catastrophe

### The Admission
Crest admitted to NHOS they used 2014 NHBC standards for a 2022/2023 build.

### NHBC's Impossible Position
As Building Control, NHBC either:
1. **Knew and approved** = Criminal offense
2. **Didn't know** = Gross incompetence/negligence

Both scenarios involve potential criminal liability under Section 35.

## Legal Implications

### Criminal Liability
- **Section 35 Building Act 1984**: Criminal offense to contravene Building Regulations
- **Penalties**: Up to 2 years imprisonment, unlimited fines
- **Continuing Offense**: Daily fines for ongoing breaches
- **No Limitation**: Can be prosecuted years later

### Who Faces Prosecution
1. **Crest Nicholson** - For building to wrong standards
2. **NHBC Officers** - For approving as Building Control
3. **Individual Directors** - Personal liability possible
4. **Site Managers** - For implementing violations

## The Systemic Failure Pattern

### Every Major Defect Represents
1. Builder failure to construct properly
2. Building Control failure to inspect (NHBC)
3. Warranty provider failure to identify (NHBC)
4. Double NHBC failure in both roles

### The Inspection Question
How did NHBC inspectors:
- Miss violations visible to homeowner?
- Approve work failing even 2014 standards?
- Sign off Building Control certificates?
- Issue warranty coverage?

## Evidence Documentation

### What We Can Prove
1. **NHBC was Building Control** - Winchester confirmation
2. **Used 2014 Standards** - Crest admission to NHOS
3. **Multiple Violations** - Trinity Rose, MJA reports
4. **NHBC Missed Everything** - Customer/consultant findings
5. **Ongoing Failures** - 18+ months of issues

### Key Documents
- Winchester Building Control confirmation
- NHOS correspondence showing 2014 standards admission
- Trinity Rose Construction Assessment
- MJA Consulting structural report
- Original NHBC certificates (fraudulent?)

## The Leverage Position

### Against NHBC
"You failed in both statutory and commercial duties:
- Criminal breach as Building Control
- Negligence as warranty provider
- Conflict of interest throughout
- Every certificate potentially fraudulent"

### Against Crest
"NHBC's dual failure doesn't absolve you:
- You still built to wrong standards
- You still created defects
- Criminal liability remains
- NHBC may seek recovery from you"

### For Buyback
"No buyer would purchase knowing:
- Building Control was compromised
- Inspections were incompetent
- Warranty based on conflicts
- Unknown defects lurk throughout"

## Questions NHBC Cannot Answer

1. How did you approve 2014 standards as 2022 Building Control?
2. Why did you miss defects failing even 2014 standards?
3. How can the same body be enforcer and commercial beneficiary?
4. Are your certificates fraudulent given the failures?
5. Who has criminal liability for these approvals?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Document all NHBC dual role evidence
2. Formal complaint to NHBC senior management
3. Report to Building Safety Regulator
4. Criminal complaint preparation
5. Media briefing preparation

### Strategic Communications
- NHBC: "Explain your dual role failure"
- Crest: "Buyback or criminal prosecution"
- Authorities: "Investigate this systemic failure"
- Media: "Watchdog was actually lapdog"

## The Bottom Line

NHBC's dual role created a massive conflict of interest that resulted in:
- Defective homes getting approved
- Building Regulations being ignored
- Consumers being failed twice
- Criminal offenses being committed

This isn't just incompetence - it's systematic failure of the entire building control and warranty system.

Plot 34 is evidence of what happens when the watchdog is paid by those it watches.
