# Email to CEO and Chairman - Version 2

Dear Mr Clark and Mr Ferguson,

The NHOS has upheld my complaint. After 18 months of denial, an independent ombudsman has confirmed what I've maintained throughout: our property has structural defects requiring remediation, not cosmetic issues deserving only goodwill gestures.

Your own structural engineer identified missing movement joints - a basic NHBC requirement that Crest somehow overlooked during construction and then denied for 18 months. The NHBC is now investigating why 2014 standards were applied to an entire 2023 development of 66 homes.

This represents our second failed Crest property. After the 25 Abbots Road buyback, we were assured there would be no repeat. Yet here we are - same dismissive treatment, same prolonged denials, same eventual vindication through external intervention.

The tragedy is how unnecessary this has been. One genuine investigation in January 2024 could have avoided 18 months of conflict, stress, and now regulatory censure.

I write not in anger but in hope that this ruling finally prompts the leadership reflection needed to prevent other families enduring what we have. Your company's tagline promises "quality homes." Perhaps it's time to deliver on that promise.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Taylor
