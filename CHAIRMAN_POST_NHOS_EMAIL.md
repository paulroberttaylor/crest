# Email to Chairman - Post-NHOS Final Decision

**To**: iain.ferguson@crestnicholson.com
**Subject**: Governance Failure - NHOS Confirms Major Defects Your CEO Denied

Dear Mr Ferguson,

As I'm sure you will be aware by now, the NHOS has upheld all aspects of my complaint against Crest Nicholson. Under the Code's definition, the missing movement joints constitute a "major defect" - a structural fault that could lead to a warranty claim. For 18 months, your company dismissed this major defect as "unnecessary," "cosmetic," and a "gesture of goodwill."

## The Facts Under Your Chairmanship

**Two Properties, Same Pattern:**
- 25 Abbots Road: First buyback due to defects
- 10 Colt View: Major defects now confirmed by NHOS

Your senior manager explicitly promised us "there would be no repeat of 25 Abbots Road." This written assurance has proven worthless.

**The Damning Timeline:**
- Spring 2025: MJA Consulting report commissioned by Crest confirms structural defects
- June 23, 2025: I sent CEO Martyn Clark the MJA report documenting these findings
- June 25, 2025: Even at this late stage, an apology and settlement could have avoided this substantial NHOS loss
- Instead: Chose to fight despite having their own engineer's report proving structural defects
- November 2024: NHOS accepted my complaint (Mr Clark already CEO)
- 2025: In response to NHOS, Crest claimed "zero breaches" of the Code
- July 15, 2025: NHOS draft decision upholds all aspects of my complaint

## The Inexcusable Strategic Failure

Your company had:
- Your own engineer's report confirming defects
- 18 months to address legitimate concerns
- Clear evidence you would lose
- A previous buyback setting precedent

Yet chose to:
- Deny major defects for 18 more months
- Claim "zero breaches" to NHOS
- Fight an unwinnable case
- Create regulatory precedent against you

This wasn't incompetence. This was hubris.

## Questions Only You Can Answer

1. Why did your CEO fight a case he knew was valid?
2. What governance oversight allowed 2014 standards to be used on 2023 construction?
3. Why does the same customer face major defects in consecutive properties?
4. What does this say about your governance?

## The Systemic Failure

Your solicitor admitted to NHOS that Crest used 2014 standards. The NHBC has confirmed 2022 standards were required. Unless our property was uniquely singled out for obsolete standards - which raises serious questions about targeting - this affects all 66 properties at Albany Wood.

As Chairman since 2019, you've presided over:
- Multiple CEOs continuing identical failures
- A culture that denies major defects
- Use of obsolete building standards
- Misrepresentation to regulators

## The Human Cost

On July 15, 2025, I required medical intervention and was prescribed antidepressants and sleeping tablets. The last four years came crashing down on me. Fighting your company over two defective properties has broken my family's health. We cannot endure months of remediation.

## The Commercial Reality

Your team must now implement the NHOS-mandated remediation. However, the true scope remains unknown until render removal. Your own surveyor warned of potential additional issues. This means:

- Complete render removal from ALL elevations
- Unknown structural issues beneath
- 8-12 weeks of work (if no complications found)
- Alternative accommodation at £3,000+/month (£6,000-£9,000 minimum)
- Requirement to achieve pristine finish on entire property
- Challenge of making it appear as originally intended
- Need for extensive quality checks throughout the process
- 65 neighbors observing major structural work on a 2023 build

The commercial reality: substantial direct costs, alternative accommodation expenses, plus significant management oversight, to achieve a result that should have been done correctly in 2023.

## Resolution Required

The conventional path - months of disruptive work on a property we can neither sell nor live in peacefully - is untenable. 

At 25 Abbots Road, when faced with intractable issues and a determined customer, your team found an elegant solution that provided certainty for all parties. That precedent demonstrated Crest's ability to think creatively when conventional approaches serve no one's interests.

Given:
- The pattern now established across two properties
- My family's documented inability to endure further disruption  
- The NHOS ruling that you denied major defects for 18 months
- Your admission of using 2014 standards on 2023 construction
- The questions this raises about your other 65 properties at Albany Wood
- The reputational implications of visible, prolonged remediation

I trust similar strategic thinking will prevail. Some situations require bold solutions.

I await your personal intervention to resolve this conclusively and finally.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Robert Taylor
