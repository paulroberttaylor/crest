# Final Email to CEO and Chairman

Dear Mr Clark and Mr Ferguson,

The NHOS has upheld my complaint. After 18 months of denial, an independent ombudsman has confirmed what I've maintained throughout: our property has structural defects requiring remediation, not cosmetic issues deserving only goodwill gestures.

The structural engineer you engaged identified missing movement joints - a basic NHBC requirement that Crest overlooked during construction and then denied for 18 months. The NHBC is now investigating why 2014 standards were applied to what I assume was the entire Albany Road development, not just plot 34.

This represents our second failed Crest property. After the 25 Abbots Road buyback, we were promised there would be no repeat. Yet here we are - the same dismissive treatment, the same prolonged denials, and the same eventual vindication through external intervention.

The tragedy is how unnecessary this has been. One genuine investigation in January 2024 could have avoided 18 months of conflict, stress, and now NHOS involvement.

We want nothing to do with Crest. If there had been no delays in 2023 with the buyback, we would not have been in the position where another Crest property was the only option.

My formal complaint to Mr Clark last week resulted from Crest not handling my initial complaint seriously. This behavior is institutional, not isolated. We've seen this render issue on two other properties on this development alone. Those homeowners were probably told it was "just settlement" too.

Your customer services manager stood on my property in early 2024 and claimed, with no technical knowledge whatsoever, that the issue was just settlement. It took until May 2025 to have someone technical engaged.

Your actions have made my family ill. This is our fourth year dealing with Crest.

I have asked the NHOS to ensure your apology acknowledges that structural work was classified as a "gesture of goodwill" by senior management for over a year. Your surveyor didn't say this was cosmetic - he said it would likely lead to early failure of the render, which as any builder knows, protects against weather degradation.

Throughout this entire process I have been made to feel like I'm asking for special favors, with Crest repeatedly characterizing the correction of structural defects as a 'gesture of goodwill' rather than acknowledging it as the bare minimum required under NHBC standards.

After 25 Abbots Road, I expected better. Plot 34 could have been your opportunity to prove that was a one-off. Instead, despite written promises from senior management, our experience has been worse. It would have been so easy to deliver what your marketing promises.

I've wasted 18 months fighting for basic acknowledgment. This dehumanizes your customers - gaslighting families into accepting that structural defects missed by construction, build managers, and Stage 12 inspections are somehow minor issues.

I will contact you again once the final decision is made, but I felt it important to address this now.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Taylor
