# The Trinity Rose Payment Fiasco
## How Crest Nicholson's £1,300 Payment Failure Contributed to Completion Delays

### Overview
Trinity Rose is an independent building consultancy that was hired to inspect Plot 34/10 Colt View. Crest Nicholson agreed to pay their £1,300 fee but failed to do so, creating a cascade of delays that contributed to the failed October 31, 2023 completion date and ongoing issues into December.

## The Trinity Rose Role

### What They Were Supposed to Do
1. Conduct independent inspection of the property
2. Identify any construction issues before completion
3. Provide a report detailing what was/wasn't completed
4. Give buyers confidence in the property condition

### What Actually Happened
1. Payment not confirmed by Crest
2. Survey delayed
3. Report withheld due to non-payment
4. Purpose of inspection defeated

## Timeline of the Fiasco

### Early October 2023 - The Agreement
- Crest Nicholson agrees to pay Trinity Rose £1,300
- Survey scheduled for October 11, 2023
- This should have allowed time to fix issues before October 31 completion

### October 9, 2023 - Payment Problems Emerge
**8:30 AM** - Paul Taylor emails Richard Kirby (Trinity Rose)
- **Subject**: "Urgent: Re: appointment on Wednesday"
- Trying to confirm attendance for October 11 survey

**8:38 AM** - Richard Kirby responds
- Payment confirmation needed before attendance
- Trinity Rose won't proceed without payment assurance

### October 11, 2023 - Survey Delayed
- Original survey date passes
- Trinity Rose doesn't attend due to payment issues
- Crest has failed to instruct them or confirm payment
- Critical timeline for October 31 completion now at risk

### October 2023 - The Knock-On Effects
- Without Trinity Rose report, condition of property unknown
- Unable to identify issues that need fixing before completion
- October 24: Solicitor confirms "not ready" for October 31
- October 31: Completion fails

### November 28-30, 2023 - Still Not Resolved
**November 28, 5:51 PM** - Oliver Culhane (Trinity Rose)
- Confirms they still haven't been paid by Crest

**November 28, 5:55 PM** - Jade Taylor's Urgent Request
> "For our solicitor, please could I just have a one line email confirming that you have not been paid. This is urgent, so I would be grateful if you could send this today."

**November 29** - Jade to Solicitor
> "Please see the email attached from Trinity Rose regarding their payment. I would be grateful if you could contact Crest to get this fee paid today so that the report can also be released today."

**November 30, 2:25 PM** - Paul Taylor sends "URGENT: Trinity Rose"
- Trinity Rose "not releasing the final report"
- Payment dispute still preventing report release

### The Critical Revelation
**From the evidence**: 
> "Crest didn't pay for Trinity Rose to provide a report of what had and had not been completed from the original survey, which defeated the object of having it done"

## The Real Impact

### 1. Delayed Property Inspection
- October 11 survey didn't happen as planned
- No time to identify and fix issues before October 31
- Contributed directly to completion failure

### 2. No Completion Report
- Trinity Rose conducted some inspection
- But without payment for completion report, findings weren't documented
- Buyers left blind about property condition
- Defeated entire purpose of independent inspection

### 3. Created Unnecessary Conflict
- Paul and Jade caught in middle
- Had to chase both Crest and Trinity Rose
- Jade had to obtain written proof of non-payment
- Added stress to already delayed purchase

### 4. Pattern of Obstruction
- Part of wider pattern of Crest creating obstacles
- Shows lack of organization and communication
- Demonstrates prioritizing cash flow over customer service

## What This Reveals

### About Crest's Operations
1. **Poor Financial Management** - Can't or won't pay agreed fees promptly
2. **Communication Breakdown** - Left hand doesn't know what right hand is doing
3. **Disregard for Agreements** - Verbal agreements mean nothing
4. **Customer Last Priority** - £1,300 payment more important than customer completion

### About the October 31 Failure
The Trinity Rose payment issue was one of several factors that caused the October 31 completion to fail:
- Updated contract not provided
- Trinity Rose inspection delayed
- Full replies to enquiries missing
- Pattern of leaving everything to last minute

## The Smoking Gun Quote

**November 30, 2023** - The Key Evidence:
> "Crest didn't pay for Trinity Rose to provide a report of what had and had not been completed from the original survey, which defeated the object of having it done"

This single sentence encapsulates the entire problem:
- Inspection happened but was useless without report
- Crest's failure to pay rendered the entire exercise pointless
- Buyers paid the price with delayed completion and unknown property issues

---

## Financial Context

### The Numbers
- **Trinity Rose Fee**: £1,300
- **Crest Nicholson Revenue**: Hundreds of millions
- **Relative Cost**: 0.0000X% of Crest's annual revenue
- **Impact of Non-Payment**: Failed completion, months of delays

### The Irony
- Crest prioritized saving/delaying £1,300
- This contributed to October 31 completion failure
- Which risked Paul and Jade's mortgage expiring
- Potentially costing everyone far more than £1,300

## Violations of New Homes Quality Code

### Principle 4 - Service
- Failed to provide agreed services (paying for inspection)
- Left buyers without critical property information

### Principle 5 - Responsiveness
- Ignored repeated requests to resolve payment
- Left issue unresolved for months

### Part 2.6 - Contract Exchange and Completion Timeline
- Trinity Rose delays contributed to failed completion
- Shows poor management of completion process

---

## Conclusion

The Trinity Rose payment fiasco exemplifies Crest Nicholson's approach to customer service:
1. Agree to something to placate buyers (pay for inspection)
2. Fail to follow through on agreement
3. Create obstacles that delay completion
4. Leave buyers to deal with consequences
5. Never take responsibility for failures

For want of a £1,300 payment, a property inspection was delayed, a completion date was missed, and buyers were put through months of additional stress. This wasn't about money - it was about a complete failure of basic business operations and customer care.

The most damning aspect: Even when they finally got an inspection, Crest's failure to pay for the completion report meant the entire exercise was pointless. Paul and Jade paid the price for Crest's incompetence with a failed October 31 completion and 45 defects found after moving in.
