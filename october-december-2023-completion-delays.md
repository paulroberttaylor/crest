# October-December 2023 Completion Delays Evidence

## Overview
This document summarizes the evidence of completion delays and obstacles created or failed to be resolved by Crest Nicholson for Plot 34 (10 Colt View) between October and December 2023.

## Key Timeline

### Early Promise vs Reality
- **Original Promise (Site Manager)**: June/July 2023 completion
- **Revised to**: September/October 2023 
- **October 31 Target**: Failed
- **Final Completion**: December 18, 2023
- **Total Delay**: 5-6 months from original promise

## October 2023 - Critical Failure Points

### October 24, 2023 - The "Not Ready" Confirmation
**From**: Hannah Rafferty (Solicitor at Bramsdon & Childs)  
**Key Quote**: "I do not believe we will be ready to complete on 31st October. We need the updated contract and full replies to the enquiries."

**What was missing**:
1. Updated contract from Crest
2. Full replies to enquiries
3. Various documentation

### October 25 vs October 31 Dispute
- **Paul's Request**: Complete by October 25 (his only available date)
- **Crest's Response**: "Not achievable"
- **Paul's Challenge**: "Please explain why 25th October is not achievable, when there are only four working days until the end of the month"
- **Reality**: Crest wanted October 31 for their "end of year targets"

## Trinity Rose Survey Issues (September-October 2023)

### The Payment Dispute That Caused Delays
1. **Agreement**: Crest agreed to pay Trinity Rose Â£1,300 for survey
2. **Problem**: Trinity Rose needed payment confirmation before attending
3. **Crest's Failure**: Failed to instruct Trinity Rose directly or confirm payment
4. **Result**: Survey delays that contributed to missing October 31 completion

### Key Evidence
- Trinity Rose would not attend without payment confirmation
- Paul had to repeatedly chase Crest about Trinity Rose payment
- Crest "reneged on agreeing to pay Trinity Rose fees" (per emails)
- Survey was supposed to happen October 11 but was delayed due to payment issues

**Critical Note**: Crest didn't pay for Trinity Rose to provide a report of what had and had not been completed from the original survey, which defeated the object of having it done.

## November 2023 - Continued Documentation Delays

### November 27, 2023
**From**: Hannah Rafferty  
**Quote**: "Once we have the amended contract and final documentation, how did you want to proceed?"  
**Status**: Still waiting for contract from Crest - nearly a month after October 31 failure

### Outstanding Items
1. Contract amendments
2. Consent for proposed works
3. Various administrative items

## December 2023 - The "URGENT" Email Pattern

### December 5-6, 2023
- Attempting to exchange for December completion
- **Outstanding**: "Only outstanding matter from a legal perspective is the consent for the proposed works"
- **Deadline Warning**: "Last day for completions is Wednesday 20th December"

### December 11-13, 2023 - Frantic Exchange Attempts
**December 12**: 
- "Your solicitor has requested an exchange today with completion on 18th December"
- Paul sends multiple URGENT emails

**December 13**:
- Hannah Rafferty: "I am chasing for the redemption statement but I do not see why this should be delaying exchange"
- More URGENT emails from Paul

### The "URGENT: 10 Colt View" Thread
**Key Statistic**: 36 emails total
- Paul sent: 25 emails
- Crest responses: Only 10 emails
- Shows pattern of Paul having to chase repeatedly for responses

### December 18, 2023
**Finally completed** after months of delays and last-minute scrambling

## Key Obstacles Created/Not Resolved by Crest

### 1. Documentation Failures
- Updated contract not provided in timely manner
- Full replies to enquiries missing
- Contract amendments delayed
- Consent for proposed works outstanding

### 2. Trinity Rose Payment Fiasco
- Crest agreed to pay but failed to confirm to Trinity Rose
- Caused survey delays in October
- Contributed to missing October 31 completion
- No report provided on completion status (defeating the purpose)

### 3. Communication Failures
- Pattern of Paul sending multiple emails before getting responses
- "URGENT" emails required to get action
- Last-minute scrambling in December due to earlier failures

### 4. Redemption Statement Delays
- Still being chased in December
- Hannah Rafferty noted this shouldn't delay exchange but it did

### 5. Administrative Obstacles
- Crest prioritized their "end of year targets" over buyer convenience
- Refused October 25 completion despite only 4 working days difference
- Created artificial urgency in December due to office closures

## Impact on Buyers

1. **Multiple Failed Completion Dates**
   - June/July 2023 (original promise)
   - October 31, 2023 (failed)
   - Multiple December attempts before finally completing

2. **Financial Impact**
   - Removals booked and cancelled
   - Time off work arranged multiple times
   - Mortgage arrangements affected

3. **Stress and Uncertainty**
   - 36-email "URGENT" thread shows level of stress
   - Having to send 25 emails to get 10 responses
   - Last-minute completion just before Christmas

## Pattern of Behavior

1. **Promise dates that can't be met**
2. **Fail to provide documentation in timely manner**
3. **Create obstacles (Trinity Rose payment issue)**
4. **Force buyers to chase repeatedly**
5. **Prioritize corporate targets over customer needs**
6. **Leave everything to last minute**

## Conclusion

The evidence shows a clear pattern where Crest Nicholson:
- Failed to meet multiple completion dates
- Created obstacles through poor administration (Trinity Rose)
- Failed to provide documentation in a timely manner
- Required constant chasing from buyers
- Prioritized their corporate needs over customer convenience

The 5-6 month delay from original promise to actual completion, combined with the stress of the "URGENT" December emails and multiple failed dates, demonstrates significant failure in Crest's completion process.
