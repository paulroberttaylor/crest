# Email to CEO and Chairman Following NHOS Decision

Good afternoon Mr Clark/Mr Ferguson,

The NHOS has ruled in my favour. After 18 months of your company calling structural defects "cosmetic", an ombudsman has ordered you to fix what your own engineer confirms are missing movement joints.

This never needed to happen. You could have listened. You could have investigated. You could have acted with integrity.

Instead, under Mr Ferguson's chairmanship, my family has now suffered through TWO defective Crest properties - one requiring buyback, one requiring structural remediation.

The NHBC is also investigating why you built to 2014 standards in 2023.

Your leadership has created a culture where customers must fight for 18 months to get basic defects acknowledged. That's your legacy.

Paul Taylor
