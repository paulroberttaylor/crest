## 3. STRUCTURAL AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

3.1 Garage damp proof course installed at less than 50% of NHBC Technical Requirements with measurements confirming 70mm installation where 150mm represents minimum acceptable standard per Chapter 5.1.16 requiring investigation of approval process, installation verification, and inspection sign-off procedures  

3.2 Ventilation provisions fundamentally compromised through air brick positioning below external ground level contradicting basic building physics principles and NHBC Chapter 6.10.4 requirements necessitating review of all ventilation provisions, inspection processes, and potential moisture-related consequences  

3.3 Sewer gas risk created through soil vent pipe terminating open-ended within loft space rather than proper connection to ventilation system per Building Regulations Part H requiring investigation of all drainage installations, inspection failures, and health implications  

3.4 Vermin access documented through unsealed roof void with gaps exceeding 4mm maximum per NHBC Chapter 7.2.19 with evidence of active infestation discovered requiring investigation of sealing specifications, inspection procedures, and remediation completeness  

3.5 Structural movement joints completely omitted from elevations measuring in excess of 6000mm length contradicting fundamental requirements for render systems and NHBC standards requiring investigation of design approval, construction verification, and long-term structural implications  

3.6 Multiple NHBC standard violations identified through independent professional assessment raising questions regarding certification process, inspection competence, and warranty validity requiring comprehensive review of all compliance documentation  

## 4. FALSE REPRESENTATIONS

4.1 Guttering cleaning was confirmed as completed. This proved false.  
4.2 Multiple property inspections were claimed. Extensive defects remained.  
4.3 Documentation supporting non-standard DPC heights was promised. None provided.  
4.4 NHBC approval was cited for non-compliant installations.  
4.5 Remedial work completion was assured. No verification permitted.  
4.6 Build manager claimed approximately 15 property checks had been conducted while simultaneously admitting customer possessed superior knowledge of NHBC standards than himself, raising fundamental questions about inspection competence and quality control validity.  

## 5. THE NHBC APPROVAL CONTRADICTION REQUIRING URGENT CLARIFICATION

5.1 Crest Nicholson has formally stated in written correspondence that NHBC approved and signed off the property including specific non-compliant elements which requires investigation of the approval process, documentation trail, and certification validity  

5.2 This approval allegedly validates 75mm garage DPC installation despite NHBC Technical Requirements Chapter 5.1.16 mandating 150mm minimum clearance raising fundamental questions about inspection procedures, technical competence, and certification integrity  

5.3 By the logic presented in Crest's correspondence, NHBC must also have approved:  
    - Complete absence of movement joints on elevations exceeding 6000mm length despite technical requirements for thermal movement accommodation  
    - 70mm DPC installation representing less than 50% of mandatory requirement yet somehow passing inspection  
    - Open soil vent pipe termination within habitable loft space creating health hazards yet receiving certification  
    - Unsealed roof voids with gaps permitting vermin access despite 4mm maximum requirement being exceeded  
    - Buried air brick installation preventing required ventilation yet passing final inspection  
    - Multiple other violations documented through independent assessment yet certified as compliant  

5.4 This contradictory position requires immediate clarification through provision of:  
    - Complete NHBC approval documentation for the specific 75mm DPC installation showing technical justification  
    - NHBC approval documentation for walls exceeding 6000mm without movement joints including risk assessment  
    - Written explanation of how installations failing to meet published standards received official certification  
    - Identification of NHBC inspector who approved these deviations from technical requirements  
    - Confirmation of whether special dispensation was granted for non-compliant work  
    - Evidence of any variation requests submitted to NHBC for reduced standards  
    - Documentation of NHBC's post-inspection review of identified violations  

5.5 The implications of NHBC approving documented violations are severe:  
    - NHBC certification becomes meaningless as quality indicator if violations are knowingly approved  
    - The warranty system offers no protection against defects if standards are not enforced  
    - Homeowner discovery has replaced professional inspection as the primary quality control  
    - Approval citations become worthless for compliance purposes if standards are optional  
    - The entire certification system requires review if such fundamental violations pass inspection  
    - Consumer confidence in NHBC warranty becomes untenable if standards are not maintained  
    - Legal implications arise if certification knowingly encompasses non-compliant work  
    - Insurance validity questions emerge if properties are certified despite violations  

5.6 This situation demands investigation of whether:  
    - NHBC was provided accurate information during inspection process  
    - Inspection actually occurred or was merely administrative  
    - Standards were waived through undocumented processes  
    - Certification was granted despite known violations  
    - Post-certification reviews identified these issues  
    - Systemic failures exist in the approval process
