## 4. Safety Violations Evidence

### Buried Air Brick
- **July 6, 2023**: Paul reports to NHBC - air brick "half buried on the drive"
- **NHBC Standard**: Air bricks must not be blocked by soil or paving
- **Risk**: Serious damp and ventilation problems
- **Identified by**: Customer, not Crest's "15 checks"

### DPC (Damp Proof Course) Violation
- **NHBC Standard**: Minimum 150mm above ground level
- **Plot 34 Reality**: Only 100mm
- **October 26, 2023**: Trinity Rose confirms "garage DPC is less than half of NHBC's minimum required tolerance"
- **December 14, 2023**: Paul educates Crest about 150mm requirement
- **January 25, 2024**: Lynn Carrington's false deflection about garage DPC requirements

### ACO Drain Installation Required
- **Issue**: DPC violation at rear of garage so serious that:
  - Entire rear path had to be lifted
  - ACO drain system installed
  - Major remedial work required
- **November 28-29, 2023**: Site manager confirms "aco run is solid with no perforation"
- **Identified by**: Customer, not Crest inspections

**Supporting Files:**
- Trinity Rose Construction Assessment reports
- NHBC correspondence
- DPC violation documentation

## 5. Communication Failures Evidence

### "URGENT: 10 Colt View" Thread Statistics
- **Period**: December 5-13, 2023 (9 days)
- **Total emails**: 36
- **Paul's emails**: 25 (requiring urgent responses)
- **Crest responses**: 10 (minimal, delayed responses)
- **Clear pattern**: Customer forced to chase repeatedly

**Supporting Files:**
- Email analysis showing communication patterns
- Specific urgent thread documentation

## 6. Trinity Rose Payment Fiasco Evidence

### The £1,300 Payment Failure
- **Agreement**: Crest to pay Trinity Rose for independent survey
- **Reality**: Payment not made, survey delayed
- **Impact**: Contributed to October 31 completion failure
- **November 30, 2023**: "Crest didn't pay for Trinity Rose to provide a report... which defeated the object"

### Timeline Impact
- **October 11, 2023**: Survey supposed to inform completion
- **October 31, 2023**: Completion fails partly due to survey delay
- **Payment failure**: Directly attributable to Crest incompetence

**Supporting Files:**
- `TRINITY_ROSE_PAYMENT_FIASCO.md`
- Trinity Rose correspondence

## 7. Proven Misrepresentations Summary

### Systematic Pattern of False Claims
1. **Completion dates**: June/July vs December reality
2. **Quality checks**: "15 checks" vs 45 defects found
3. **Gutter cleaning**: Confirmed clean vs drone proof of lies
4. **DPC adequacy**: "Acceptable" vs expert assessment of violation
5. **Trinity Rose payment**: Promised vs never made

### Corporate Strategy Evidence

- **Prioritize corporate targets**: October 31 over October 25
- **Misrepresent condition**: Multiple proven lies
- **Exhaust customers**: 2.5:1 communication ratio

### Documented Breaches
