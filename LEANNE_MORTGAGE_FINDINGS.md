4. **Only 3 emails** in the entire dataset explicitly mention mortgage fees
5. **Leanna Hill** (the solicitor) was involved during the critical completion period when mortgage issues arose

### Timeline Context
- **December 13, 2023**: Mortgage invoice PDFs attached to emails
- **December 18, 2023**: Leanna Hill involved in "10 Colt View" discussions
- **December 22, 2023**: Paul raises "Mortgage Broker Fee Still Unpaid" issue
- **December 23, 2023**: NHBC Cover Note sent (day after mortgage fee complaint)

### Recommendation
The mortgage broker fee issue appears to be another example of Crest's poor handling during the completion process. The fact that Paul had to chase for payment of a broker fee just days before completion adds to the pattern of:
- Last-minute issues
- Financial matters not properly handled
- Customer having to chase for basic completion requirements

This could be included as evidence of the stressful and poorly managed purchase completion process in any NHOS complaint about treatment during purchase.
