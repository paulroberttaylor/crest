Based on £490,000 mortgage:
- Best rate available: 4.38%
- Rate forced to accept: 4.72%
- **Total additional interest over 5 years: £8,136.87**

## Pattern of Warnings

### June 6, 2023
Multiple emails warning Crest about mortgage impact:
- Borrowing ability dropped by £6,000
- Mortgage in principle expired
- Rates continuing to rise

### Crest's Response
- **June 7, 2023**: Tim Fogarty (Crest's solicitor) confirmed Crest "is not willing to change the purchase price"
- No accommodation made despite clear evidence of financial harm

## Note on 1.5% Rate
- No evidence found of a 1.5% mortgage rate in 2023 emails or PDFs
- Lowest rate found was 4.38% (February 2023)
- Paul plans to contact Leanne Athill directly to clarify if earlier rate was discussed

## Conclusion
Clear evidence exists showing:
1. Paul and Jade had access to 4.38% rate in early 2023
2. Crest's delays caused them to lose this rate
3. They were forced to accept 4.72%
4. This results in £8,136.87 additional interest over 5 years
5. They explicitly warned Crest this would happen
6. Crest refused to accommodate despite knowing the impact
