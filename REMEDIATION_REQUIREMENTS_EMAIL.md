# Remediation Requirements Email - Post-NHOS Final Decision

Dear [Recipient],

Following the NHOS final decision requiring structural remediation of our property, I am writing to understand the full scope and impact of the proposed works on our family.

As you'll appreciate, having already experienced significant disruption during the initial construction phase (which exceeded promised timelines by six months), I require comprehensive information before we can proceed.

**Pre-commencement Requirements:**

Given that I work from home and our son will be home during school holidays, I need:
- Detailed method statements for each phase of work
- Acoustic impact assessments with specific decibel levels and duration
- Firm start and completion dates for each element
- Written guarantees regarding scaffold safety, including weekly inspection certificates
- Comprehensive dust and debris mitigation plans
- Evidence of how zero render debris in our garden will be achieved

**Scope Clarification:**

Your surveyor indicated that full scope cannot be determined until render removal. Therefore, please provide:
- Detailed contingency plans for each potential discovery
- Timeline implications for each scenario
- How additional defects will be addressed
- Decision trees for various structural issues that may be uncovered
- Who will have authority to approve variations
- How timeline extensions will be communicated

**Quality Assurance:**

Based on our previous experience where 45 defects were identified despite claims of "15 inspections," I require:
- Named individuals responsible for each work element
- Daily photographic progress reports
- Third-party quality inspections at each stage
- Written specifications for "pristine finish"
- Detailed remediation plans for any collateral damage
- 10-year insurance-backed guarantee on all work

**Practical Considerations:**

Please also address:
- How you will ensure zero disruption to our neighbors
- Parking arrangements for contractors
- Site security during works
- Protection of our property boundaries
- Air quality monitoring given render dust concerns
- Alternative accommodation if works become unbearable

I'm particularly concerned about the open-ended nature of this project. Without knowing what lies beneath the render, how can you provide any meaningful timeline? Our family cannot plan around "it depends what we find."

Given these reasonable requirements for such extensive works, I would appreciate your detailed response addressing each point. If you cannot provide these assurances, perhaps we should discuss alternative resolutions that provide certainty for all parties.

I look forward to your comprehensive response within 14 days.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Taylor

**Why this is cruel without being obvious:**
1. Every request is reasonable but collectively impossible
2. References their past failures without dwelling
3. Demands specifics they cannot provide
4. Creates administrative nightmare
5. Sets impossible standards ("zero debris")
6. Hints at "alternative resolutions" 
7. 14-day deadline adds pressure
8. Positions them to suggest buyback themselves
