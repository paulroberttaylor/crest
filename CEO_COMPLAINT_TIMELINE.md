**May 18, 2023** - First Major Misrepresentation

- Despite clear evidence of financial harm from their delays

- Site manager confirms "the aco run is solid with no perforation and connects in to the downpipe located between the house and garage"

## Conclusion: A Pattern of Systematic Failure

This timeline reveals that Paul and Jade Taylor's experience was not a series of unfortunate mistakes, but a systematic pattern of:

1. **Deliberate Misrepresentation** (gutter cleaning, 15 checks, DPC adequacy)
2. **Financial Harm Without Compensation** (£8,136.87 mortgage loss)
3. **Safety Violations** (buried air brick, inadequate DPC, drainage issues)
4. **Customer Service Failures** (2.5:1 communication ratio, completion day disaster)
5. **Quality Control Breakdown** (45 defects despite claimed inspections)

The fact that customers had to identify serious building safety violations that Crest's "15 checks" missed demonstrates either:
- **Complete failure** of Crest's quality control systems, or
- **Deliberate misrepresentation** of inspection processes

Either conclusion represents a fundamental breach of the duty of care owed to customers making their largest life purchase.

**Mr. Clark, this is the systematic customer mistreatment happening under your leadership. This pattern must end.**
