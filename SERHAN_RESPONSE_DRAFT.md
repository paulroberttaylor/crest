# Response to Serhan - NDA Breach

Dear Serhan,

Thank you for your advice. I'm struggling to think clearly due to the stress, but here are the specific breach details:

**The Specific Breach:**

The Memorandum of Agreement (Clause 9.2) states:
> "save as required by law or regulation or with the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)"

**What Happened:**
1. I requested written consent from CEO Martyn Clark to discuss 25 Abbots Road with NHOS (the regulator investigating my current property issues)
2. He refused consent
3. He provided NO reason for refusal - not even an attempt at justification
4. The clause explicitly states consent cannot be "unreasonably withheld"
5. Refusing without ANY reason is the definition of unreasonable

**Why This Matters:**
- NHOS needs the full pattern of behavior across both properties to make a fair decision
- Crest is using the NDA as a weapon to hide their systematic failures
- They're not just withholding consent with poor reasons - they're refusing to give ANY reason
- This prevents me from getting justice on my current home

**My Question:**
Does refusing consent without providing any justification constitute unreasonable withholding under Clause 9.2? Can I argue this refusal breaches the contract sufficiently to allow disclosure to NHOS specifically?

I'm not seeking to void the entire agreement - just to establish that their unreasonable refusal allows me to make this specific regulatory disclosure.

Kind regards,
Paul
