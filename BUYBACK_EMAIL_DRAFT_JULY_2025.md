Dear Mr Clark and Mr Ferguson,

Following the recent NHOS decision upholding all aspects of my complaint, the scope of required work presents insurmountable challenges.

MJA Consulting has identified that movement joints must be installed, but also flagged that bed joints need to be checked and all blockwork needs to be checked for full curing before use. The scope cannot be determined until all render is stripped from the property. As demonstrated at 25 Abbots Road, this kind of work needs thorough planning, ensuring that every eventuality is accounted for, and my family obviously can't be inhabiting the house while the work is done.

Given:
- Complete render removal from all elevations
- Unknown investigation findings (potential green blocks, missing bed joint reinforcement)
- Indefinite timeline depending on discoveries  
- Need for alternative accommodation throughout
- Our family's mental health after four years of property disputes with Crest, with GP letters being prepared which will be forwarded to Crest and to the NHOS if this is not concluded in the correct manner

At 25 Abbots Road, despite dozens of issues, no regulatory body mandated structural work. Nevertheless, your team found an elegant solution that provided certainty for all parties. This time, the NHOS decision requires you to carry out extensive remediation with no ability to appeal - a fundamentally different situation requiring creative thinking.

One NHOS complaint has already been upheld with another potentially following from my CEO complaint documenting 50+ defects, false information, and 5-month contract delays. Your solicitors' admission to NHOS of using 2014 standards on our 2023 build has been flagged with the NHBC CEO's office and a response that this is being looked into given.

We request your consideration of a practical solution that avoids months of disruptive remediation and allows both parties to move forward.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Taylor
