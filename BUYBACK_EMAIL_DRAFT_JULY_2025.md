Dear Mr Clark and Mr Ferguson,

Following the recent NHOS decision upholding all aspects of my complaint, the scope of required work presents insurmountable challenges.

A senior manager in charge of the region explicitly promised us during the purchase process that 'there would be no repeat of 25 Abbots Road.' This written assurance has proven worthless. Despite concerns raised to CEO level in the second half of 2024, here we are again with major defects confirmed by your own engineer.

MJA Consulting has identified that movement joints must be installed, but also flagged that bed joints need to be checked and all blockwork needs to be checked for full curing before use. The scope cannot be determined until all render is stripped from the property. As demonstrated at 25 Abbots Road, this kind of work needs thorough planning, ensuring that every eventuality is accounted for, and my family obviously can't be inhabiting the house while the work is done.

Given:
- Complete render removal from all elevations
- Unknown investigation findings (potential green blocks, missing bed joint reinforcement)
- Indefinite timeline depending on discoveries  
- Need for alternative accommodation throughout
- Our family's mental health after four years of property disputes with Crest, with GP letters being prepared which will be forwarded to Crest and to the NHOS if this is not concluded in the correct manner

At 25 Abbots Road, despite dozens of issues, no regulatory body mandated structural work. Nevertheless, your team found an elegant solution that provided certainty for all parties. This time, the NHOS decision requires you to carry out extensive remediation with no ability to appeal - a fundamentally different situation requiring creative thinking.

With one NHOS complaint upheld, my pending CEO complaint documenting 50+ defects, false information, and 5-month contract delays may follow the same path. The NHBC CEO's office is now investigating your solicitors' admission that 2014 standards were used on our 2023 build.

We request your consideration of a practical solution that avoids months of disruptive remediation and allows both parties to move forward with the matter remaining fully private.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Taylor
