# Mortgage Extension Evidence Summary

## Key Findings

Based on the email analysis, here is the evidence that Paul and Jade needed to get a second mortgage offer or extend their existing mortgage offer due to Crest's delays:

### 1. **June 6, 2023 - Mortgage Rate Impact**
- **Email from:** Paul Taylor to Crest
- **Key Evidence:** "Our mortgage advisor has informed us that the rates have gone up, meaning our borrowing ability has dropped by approximately £6k"
- **Impact:** Direct financial impact of £6,000 reduction in borrowing ability due to delays
- **Context:** Paul explicitly told Adrian Sims and Peter Truscott (CEO) that "the delays are jeopardising everything"

### 2. **November 1, 2023 - Mortgage Expiry Threats Begin**
Multiple emails between Paul Taylor and solicitor Hannah Rafferty expressing serious concerns about mortgage offer expiry:

- **November 1, 2023 08:18:** Paul instructs solicitor to tell Crest "if our mortgage offer expires, they will have to do the work on 25 Abbots Road, and they lose their non disclosure agreement"
- **November 1, 2023 10:44:** Paul states "We're worried about the mortgage offer; we could have been moved in already had they done their job properly"
- **November 1, 2023 13:02:** Hannah Rafferty confirms she "expressed the concern (again) regarding the mortgage offer expiry"

### 3. **November 7, 2023 - Continued Expiry Concerns**
- Hannah Rafferty reiterates she has "chased them and expressed the concern (again) regarding the mortgage offer expiry"
- The word "again" indicates this was an ongoing concern raised multiple times

### 4. **December 13, 2023 - Deliberate Delay Suspicions**
- **Critical Evidence:** "At this point we think they are doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires. There's no other explanation"
- This shows Paul and solicitor believed Crest was intentionally delaying to force mortgage expiry

### 5. **Timeline Analysis**
- **Original completion promise:** June/July 2023 (per site manager)
- **First delay:** Pushed to September/October 2023
- **Second delay:** Set for October 31, 2023
- **Third delay:** October 24 - confirmed not ready
- **Actual completion:** December 18, 2023
- **Total delay:** 5-6 months from original estimate

### 6. **Pattern of Mortgage Concerns**
The email analysis shows:
- **November 2023:** 10 emails with mortgage expiry concerns (100% of mortgage emails that month)
- **December 2023:** 2 emails with expiry concerns out of 24 mortgage-related emails
- The concentration in November suggests this was when the original mortgage offer was approaching expiry

## Evidence of Financial Impact

While the emails don't explicitly state that a second mortgage application was made, they show:

1. **Borrowing ability dropped by £6,000** due to rate increases during delays (June 2023)
2. **Serious concerns about mortgage offer expiry** expressed repeatedly from November 2023
3. **Solicitor repeatedly raised mortgage expiry concerns** with Crest
4. **Suspicion of deliberate delays** to force mortgage expiry (December 2023)

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly suggests that:
- Paul and Jade's original mortgage offer was at risk of expiring due to Crest's 5-6 month delays
- They suffered a £6,000 reduction in borrowing ability due to rate increases during the delay period
- The mortgage expiry threat was used as leverage to try to force Crest to complete
- By December 2023, they believed Crest was deliberately delaying to force their mortgage to expire

While we don't have explicit confirmation of a second mortgage application, the timeline and level of concern expressed strongly indicates they were either forced to extend their offer or reapply, incurring additional costs and stress due to Crest's delays.
