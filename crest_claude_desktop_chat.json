Here's a summary of what I discovered:\n\n## **Key Email Threads Found:**\n\n### **1. Crest Nicholson Correspondence (Plot 34/10 Colt View - Render Issues)**\n- **Main thread**: Multiple emails from April-May 2025 discussing render crack repairs\n- **Key contacts**: Donna Hack (Customer Service Manager), Customer Service SO\n- **Timeline**: Ongoing scheduling of independent surveyor (Robert Fleming, MJA Consulting Civil & Structural Engineers) to inspect render crack\n- **Latest status**: Surveyor visit was scheduled and confirmed for May 22, 2025\n\n### **2. NHOS Case NHOS-2024-000512**\n- **Case subject**: 10 Colt View render and other issues\n- **Status**: With ombudsman for decision\n- **Key developments**:\n  - Case accepted January 2025\n  - Allocated to ombudsman March 31, 2025\n  - Developer responses received April 2025 (with large PDF attachments)\n  - Additional information requested from both parties\n  - You submitted photos and rebuttals in April-May 2025\n\n### **3. Key Issues Identified:**\n1. **Render crack** - recurring issue that Crest initially said they wouldn't fix further, but later agreed to address\n2. **Path/footpath work** - additional planning permission issues on development site\n3. **NHBC standards** - questions about construction standards used\n\n### **4. Large Email Attachments Found:**\nSeveral emails contain significant PDF attachments (3MB+, 14MB+, 30MB+), particularly:\n- NHOS emails from April 22 and May 20, 2025 containing developer responses\n- Your emails to NHOS with supporting documentation and photos\n\n## **Limitation:**\nUnfortunately, I cannot access or analyze the PDF attachments directly through Gmail. The attachments appear to contain:\n- Crest Nicholson's formal responses to NHOS\n- Planning documentation and drawings\n- Photos of render damage\n- Technical reports and correspondence\n\n## **Next Steps:**\nTo review the PDF attachments, you would need to:\n1. Download them directly from your Gmail\n2. Use Desktop Commander to read local PDF files if you save them to your computer\n3. Or provide specific questions about content you remember from the attachments\n\nWould you like me to help you with any specific aspect of this correspondence, or would you prefer to download and analyze any particular PDF attachments using Desktop Commander?",

The portal is now showing a deadline to respond date of tomorrow, but as far as I am aware there are no other responses required. The builder had several weeks extra from the date shown on the update on the portal when I emailed last, and the portal now suggests that the decision is still not ready to be made. I understand that there are issues with the technical solution but I have been very patient and just need the decision. Crest has started work on the path, contradicting their MD's final response to me. They also agreed to fully re-render the house, again, contradicting their final response to this. Please could you advise when the decision will be made and sent out?

          "text": "\n\nBased on my comprehensive search of your Gmail, I found substantial email correspondence regarding Plot 34 / 10 Colt View between you, Crest Nicholson, and NHOS. Here's a summary of what I discovered:\n\n## **Key Email Threads Found:**\n\n### **1. Crest Nicholson Correspondence (Plot 34/10 Colt View - Render Issues)**\n- **Main thread**: Multiple emails from April-May 2025 discussing render crack repairs\n- **Key contacts**: Donna Hack (Customer Service Manager), Customer Service SO\n- **Timeline**: Ongoing scheduling of independent surveyor (Robert Fleming, MJA Consulting Civil & Structural Engineers) to inspect render crack\n- **Latest status**: Surveyor visit was scheduled and confirmed for May 22, 2025\n\n### **2. NHOS Case NHOS-2024-000512**\n- **Case subject**: 10 Colt View render and other issues\n- **Status**: With ombudsman for decision\n- **Key developments**:\n  - Case accepted January 2025\n  - Allocated to ombudsman March 31, 2025\n  - Developer responses received April 2025 (with large PDF attachments)\n  - Additional information requested from both parties\n  - You submitted photos and rebuttals in April-May 2025\n\n### **3. Key Issues Identified:**\n1. **Render crack** - recurring issue that Crest initially said they wouldn't fix further, but later agreed to address\n2. **Path/footpath work** - additional planning permission issues on development site\n3. **NHBC standards** - questions about construction standards used\n\n### **4. Large Email Attachments Found:**\nSeveral emails contain significant PDF attachments (3MB+, 14MB+, 30MB+), particularly:\n- NHOS emails from April 22 and May 20, 2025 containing developer responses\n- Your emails to NHOS with supporting documentation and photos\n\n## **Limitation:**\nUnfortunately, I cannot access or analyze the PDF attachments directly through Gmail. The attachments appear to contain:\n- Crest Nicholson's formal responses to NHOS\n- Planning documentation and drawings\n- Photos of render damage\n- Technical reports and correspondence\n\n## **Next Steps:**\nTo review the PDF attachments, you would need to:\n1. Download them directly from your Gmail\n2. Use Desktop Commander to read local PDF files if you save them to your computer\n3. Or provide specific questions about content you remember from the attachments\n\nWould you like me to help you with any specific aspect of this correspondence, or would you prefer to download and analyze any particular PDF attachments using Desktop Commander?",

Here's what I can summarize from the available emails:\n\n## **Summary of Move-In Date Issues Found:**\n\n### **Move-In Day - December 18, 2023:**\nThe email thread from December 18, 2023 shows the actual move-in day challenges:\n\n**Key Timeline:**\n- **2:24 PM**: You requested keys to begin moving in \n- **2:28 PM**: Eileen Guihen replied that keys couldn't be released until legal completion, but offered access to \"start off loading while we wait\"\n- **2:40 PM**: You complained they only gave garage access, which wasn't useful\n- **2:47 PM**: You insisted on house access, not just garage\n- **2:51 PM**: You specifically mentioned \"**We are supposed to have the keys at 1pm**\"\n- **2:54 PM**: Eileen confirmed the sales office was opening the house, stating \"Keys are never released prior to legal completion\"\n\n### **Build Delays Leading Up to Move-In:**\nFrom the November 2023 emails, there's evidence of prolonged delays:\n\n**November 23, 2023** (draft email):\n- You mentioned being \"almost a full calendar month since you advised the property would be ready to move in\"\n- Reference to your son's health issues and not being able to tell him when you'd be settled\n- Statement: \"We have done everything we are able to, including having the message to the NHBC ready with our solicitors\"\n\n**Earlier November 2023 emails show:**\n- Multiple Trinity Rose inspections being rescheduled\n- DPC (Damp Proof Course) work needing completion\n- Issues with Stage 12 inspections\n- Quality concerns that were supposed to be resolved before move-in\n\n### **Key Issues Identified:**\n1. **Scheduled vs. Actual**: You were supposed to have keys at 1pm on December 18th, but legal completion hadn't occurred\n2. **Repeated Delays**: References to being \"almost a full calendar month\" past when the property was supposed to be ready\n3. **Family Impact**: Mentions of your son's health and not being able to provide certainty about moving dates\n4. **Build Quality**: Ongoing issues that were supposed to be resolved pre-completion\n\n### **Missing Information:**\nHowever, I did **not find specific emails** that detail:\n- The exact duration boxes were packed\n- Multiple date changes over months\n- Specific correspondence about repeatedly postponed completion dates\n\nThis suggests that either:\n1. These discussions happened via phone calls rather than email\n2. The emails predate January 2023 (outside my search range)\n3. They may be in threads that don't contain the search terms I used\n\nWould you like me to search with different terms or timeframes to find more specific correspondence about the repeated date changes and packed boxes situation?",

The legal agreement between us contains clear stipulations that apply to both parties. I have fully adhered to my obligations under the agreement, but the same cannot be said for Crest Nicholson. As the agreement explicitly states, consent to discuss its terms *must not be unreasonably withheld.* Crest has failed to provide any reasonable justification for its refusal, beyond a blanket denial, despite multiple requests. As such, Crest is not upholding the terms of its own agreement. The continued lack of response only reinforces that Crest is not committed to the agreement it drafted. Without compliance from both parties, the enforceability of the agreement itself is called into question. I expect a response without further delay.

Your refusal, without justification, represents a clear breach of the agreement. This failure to provide a valid reason violates the terms of the agreement. If permission continues to be denied without proper justification, I will consider the terms of the NDA void due to Crest's failure to comply with the agreement.

THINK BEFORE YOU CLICK: Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. Do not enter your ID and Password and think before you accept any Multi Factor Authentication prompt.] Mr. Clark, I am writing to address the ongoing issue concerning the render repair at my property. From the outset, it was made clear to Crest Nicholson's representative, with the Weber representative present, that the expectation for any repair was to achieve an as-new finish with no visible evidence of prior issues. Yet, a repair method was chosen that, as now acknowledged, could never meet this standard. This critical limitation was not disclosed to me before work began. Only after completion was it explained that the chosen repair would not result in a seamless finish, contrary to what any new homeowner would expect. The suggestion that Crest Nicholson did not consider this standard implicit for a new home is disappointing, to say the least. Additionally, it was stated by Mark Foyle that a joint inspection of the repair would take place with both Crest and myself. No such joint review occurred. Instead, a staff member evidently inspected the work without my knowledge or consent, as the repair is only visible from the scaffolding, requiring access to my property. Had I been present, I would have made it clear immediately that the repair did not meet my expressly stated expectations for a seamless finish. I am also not going to have a meeting with senior Crest management regarding this issue, and I do not wish to have to keep repeating this decision. Based on past experiences with Crest, in-person meetings are rarely pleasant. To pre-empt any attempt by Crest to characterize my refusal to meet as \\\"uncooperative\\\"-for example, \\\"Mr. Taylor refused to meet with Crest representatives. We tried to manage this, but the customer was uncooperative\\\"-I formally request, as per the NDA for 25 Abbots Road, permission to disclose our experience with Crest at the previous property to the NHOS. This would provide necessary context regarding my discomfort with in-person meetings with senior Crest staff. Frankly, I am astounded that a CEO would sanction this substandard solution, especially knowing what Crest put my family through previously at 25 Abbots Road. To then send the very build director responsible for that previous property to try to \\\"discuss\\\" their way out of doing a proper job here is both inappropriate and insulting. I am further astounded that Crest Nicholson would knowingly sanction a solution that could not ensure a consistent, as-new finish. It is genuinely absurd to now be debating whether the repair should achieve this level-this should be the baseline for any reputable builder. The continued insistence on further visits to \\\"discuss\\\" this only prolongs what is a straightforward matter of quality. Any defense of a visibly subpar repair-particularly by invoking NHBC's absolute minimum standards-only reinforces a reluctance to provide the standard of work that any new homeowner would expect. In addition to a request for permission to discuss the experience of 25 Abbots Road with the NHOS, I am also formally requesting a copy of the inspection report produced by your staff member following their visit to our property. It is necessary to understand the basis on which this repair was deemed acceptable, considering the expected standard of an as-new finish, known to Crest. There is nothing further to discuss unless an agreement is reached to re-render the entire wall face to achieve a seamless, as-new finish. As this matter has not been satisfactorily addressed, a formal complaint will be submitted to the New Homes Ombudsman Service (NHOS) today. However, should Crest Nicholson agree to carry out a proper re-render to meet the expected standard, the complaint will be closed.

I've already had confirmation that someone from Crest has visited and signed off the repair, and also an email stating that a repair will never leave the render in the pristine condition it should be, which Crest has been aware of all this time. I only need a response as to whether it will be done so that it does look like a new render, or not. As it weathers it will become and more noticeable.

THINK BEFORE YOU CLICK: Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. Do not enter your ID and Password and think before you accept any Multi Factor Authentication prompt.] Good morning, Based on the previous emails from Crest, it was known that a repair would not make the render look new, as it should. I should have been informed of this months ago, not when the scaffolding is due to come down. I have also spoken to Weber, who advised that a repair will never guarantee that there will be no evidence of an issue. Crest knew this and still decided to proceed with the minimal repair rather than re-rendering the entire wall face to ensure a seamless finish. Apparently, someone from Crest has checked the work, yet no one knocked on my door. Did your member of staff enter my property and go on the scaffolding without my permission or knowledge? I was home the entire week and saw no representative from Crest. I fail to see how the work could have been checked without accessing the scaffolding. There was supposed to be a day when Crest and I would check the work together. Again, no one knocked on my door. If they had, I would have advised that a visible scar was not acceptable. I told your member of staff who accompanied Weber that whatever fix is done needs to be done so that there is no evidence that there were any issues, and I was assured that this would be passed on. I would like a response today regarding what is going to be done not in seven working days. Having admitted that a repair will not make the render look new and failing to inform me of this, is Crest going to replace the render on that face while it's dry and the scaffolding is still up? Or do we have to proceed with contacting the NHOS again, where I will provide evidence that Crest knowingly performed a repair they knew would not look like a new render on a new house, and that the new CEO has been aware of this and allowed a job to be done knowing it is just a patch job?

If permission continues to be denied without proper justification, I will consider the terms of the NDA void due to Crest's failure to comply with the agreement.

Following past emails with Mr Truscott regarding our son's health, we are still not able to tell him when we will be settled. We have spoken with his doctor again this week. The NHBC resolution was meant to have been satisfied by the 1st September so that my family was not subjected to any more undue stress caused by Crest Nicholson. At this point we may need to contact the NHBC to advise them of the situation. The communication between solicitors has to happen quickly now. We are almost a full calendar month since you advised the property would be ready to move in to. Major items like DPC work had to be done which could not have been checked. We have done everything we are able to, including having the message to the NHBC ready with our solicitors. 1. Trinity Rose has advised that the report for the checks this week will not be produced until their payment issue is resolved. This is holding up the ability to go to exchange. Please contact them as soon as possible to address this. 2. Could you please confirm that Stage 12 checks will be repeated as we were very concerned with the amount of work that was needed from Trinity Rose's inspection, which were not picked up by that internal check before Trinity Rose was arranged. The original Stage 12 report is now not valid. Please could you clarify what the Stage 12 checks entail? 3. Trinity Rose reported that the boxing in the kitchen, initially raised at the start of summer, is still incorrect. As per the reservation agreement, all items outside NHBC tolerances are to be rectified. Please explain why this has not been done. 4. Kindly confirm when the updated contract, including the extra 3-day possession clause, will be sent to our solicitors. This was confirmed in an email from you on Monday 9th October, and our solicitors are still waiting for this to be added to the contract. When will this be with them? 5. Trinity Rose was scheduled to conduct a comprehensive review of the house for occupation readiness on the 11th October. However, the house was not ready for their complete checks at that time. Crest and Trinity Rose agreed to proceed with the structural aspects on that day to avoid delays, with the understanding that the remaining checks against the NHBC technical standards would be scheduled later. Quality of finishes is covered under these technical standards, as referenced in our Reservation Agreement: *Paragraph 19 c: If the surveyor identifies works that are required to meet the NHBC technical standards or Building Regulations, the seller is obligated to complete these works within a reasonable timeframe.* Despite this, Crest's solicitors have indicated that no cosmetic checks will be performed, even though there was outstanding work needed at the time of the 11th October visit. We anticipated, and were promised, a finish quality surpassing that of 25 Abbots Road, which was to be verified by Trinity Rose. I am concerned this might be a misunderstanding by Crest's solicitors. Please confirm that Trinity Rose will be conducting these essential checks and inform us of the rescheduled inspection date, considering the incomplete tasks noted during the initial visit. In our discussions with Mr. Sims, it was made clear to us that there would not be a repeat of 25 Abbots Road and repeat of the stress caused by post-move-in repairs. Therefore, promptly addressing these issues is critical. The quality of finish, as part of the NHBC's technical standards, is of particular importance to us given the experience with the property on the Tangier development, and the reason for the subsequent buy-back of 25 Abbots Road. We need an urgent response to these points as we are now at a standstill with no sight of when exchange may be, and no sight of when removals and the door company can be arranged.

      "text": "\n\nBased on my comprehensive search through your Gmail, I found very limited email correspondence that specifically describes waiting for move-in dates with boxes packed for months. Here's what I can summarize from the available emails:\n\n## **Summary of Move-In Date Issues Found:**\n\n### **Move-In Day - December 18, 2023:**\nThe email thread from December 18, 2023 shows the actual move-in day challenges:\n\n**Key Timeline:**\n- **2:24 PM**: You requested keys to begin moving in \n- **2:28 PM**: Eileen Guihen replied that keys couldn't be released until legal completion, but offered access to \"start off loading while we wait\"\n- **2:40 PM**: You complained they only gave garage access, which wasn't useful\n- **2:47 PM**: You insisted on house access, not just garage\n- **2:51 PM**: You specifically mentioned \"**We are supposed to have the keys at 1pm**\"\n- **2:54 PM**: Eileen confirmed the sales office was opening the house, stating \"Keys are never released prior to legal completion\"\n\n### **Build Delays Leading Up to Move-In:**\nFrom the November 2023 emails, there's evidence of prolonged delays:\n\n**November 23, 2023** (draft email):\n- You mentioned being \"almost a full calendar month since you advised the property would be ready to move in\"\n- Reference to your son's health issues and not being able to tell him when you'd be settled\n- Statement: \"We have done everything we are able to, including having the message to the NHBC ready with our solicitors\"\n\n**Earlier November 2023 emails show:**\n- Multiple Trinity Rose inspections being rescheduled\n- DPC (Damp Proof Course) work needing completion\n- Issues with Stage 12 inspections\n- Quality concerns that were supposed to be resolved before move-in\n\n### **Key Issues Identified:**\n1. **Scheduled vs. Actual**: You were supposed to have keys at 1pm on December 18th, but legal completion hadn't occurred\n2. **Repeated Delays**: References to being \"almost a full calendar month\" past when the property was supposed to be ready\n3. **Family Impact**: Mentions of your son's health and not being able to provide certainty about moving dates\n4. **Build Quality**: Ongoing issues that were supposed to be resolved pre-completion\n\n### **Missing Information:**\nHowever, I did **not find specific emails** that detail:\n- The exact duration boxes were packed\n- Multiple date changes over months\n- Specific correspondence about repeatedly postponed completion dates\n\nThis suggests that either:\n1. These discussions happened via phone calls rather than email\n2. The emails predate January 2023 (outside my search range)\n3. They may be in threads that don't contain the search terms I used\n\nWould you like me to search with different terms or timeframes to find more specific correspondence about the repeated date changes and packed boxes situation?",

Let me search for more emails from earlier in 2023 that would show this pattern of delays and date changes.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nLet me search for earlier correspondence from mid-2023 to find the original timeline promises:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nLet me search more specifically for earlier promises about summer completion dates:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nNow let me read the key thread to understand the timeline better:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nBased on my comprehensive analysis of the email correspondence, here's a summary of the move-in date delays and Crest Nicholson's behaviour regarding Plot 34 / 10 Colt View:\n\n## **Timeline of Delays - Plot 34 Move-In Dates:**\n\n### **July 2023: Initial Phone Contact**\n- **July 17th**: Danielle Green from Crest called about mortgage status and informed you of the \"unusual nature\" of the sale, promising an amended contract \"the following week\"\n- This contract never materialized for weeks\n\n### **August 2023: First Major Delays**\n- **August 17th**: You complained that solicitors had been trying unsuccessfully to contact Crest for weeks\n- **August 30th**: Still no response from Crest on basic queries\n- You only had \"vague estimates of September or October\" for completion\n\n### **September 2023: Shifting to October**\n- **September 1st**: Natalie Haigh stated \"We are aiming for an October completion\"\n- **September 28th**: Crest finally said they were \"aiming to achieve CML this week\" and invited you to visit from October 9th\n- Packing materials ordered for early September in preparation\n\n### **October 2023: Pressure and More Delays**\n- **October 4th**: You complained they wanted you to \"move by the end of October to hit their sales targets\"\n- **October 5th**: Steve Smith asking when your survey was booked \"to enable completion by the end of October\"\n- **October 10th**: You pointed out \"25th October is only four working days until the end of the month\"\n\n### **November 2023: Extended Delays**\n- **November 8th**: You stated it was \"14 days since Crest received Trinity Rose's report\" with no response\n- **November 23rd**: Draft email mentioning you were \"almost a full calendar month since you advised the property would be ready to move in\"\n- References to your son's health issues and inability to tell him when you'd be settled\n\n### **December 2023: Finally Moving**\n- **December 18th**: Actual move-in day with key handover issues\n- You specifically stated \"We are supposed to have the keys at 1pm\" but completion hadn't occurred\n- Multiple emails about garage vs. house access during moving day\n\n## **Key Issues Demonstrating Poor Behaviour:**\n\n### **1. Repeated Broken Promises:**\n- Promised amended contract in July - not delivered for months\n- Multiple completion date estimates that kept shifting\n- Solicitor communication failures lasting weeks\n\n### **2. Sales Target Pressure:**\n- Direct admission from sales staff that they weren't allowed holidays in October\n- Pushing for completion by month-end for their targets, not customer convenience\n- Rushing the process despite incomplete internal inspections\n\n### **3. Poor Communication:**\n- Solicitors unable to reach Crest's legal team for weeks\n- Trinity Rose surveyor never contacted by Crest despite joint agreement\n- Multiple unanswered emails requiring repeated follow-ups\n\n### **4. Impact on Your Family:**\n- Having to contact your son's doctor about ongoing uncertainty\n- Boxes and packing materials ordered months in advance\n- Removal company costs increased due to Crest's delays and poor coordination\n\n### **5. Build Quality Issues:**\n- Stage 12 inspections not completed until the last minute\n- Kitchen boxing issues raised in summer still not fixed by October\n- Multiple items needing rectification that should have been caught earlier\n\nThe emails clearly show a pattern of Crest Nicholson making commitments they couldn't keep, shifting dates repeatedly, and putting their sales targets ahead of customer care - exactly the \"shocking behaviour\" you described.",

Several issues have arisen that need immediate attention: *Surveyor's Visit*: The surveyor from Trinity Rose is unable to do a complete check of the property. The house is missing its carpet, and there are items that should have been addressed by Stage 12. These include issues with the kitchen boxing, wall painting, and gloss work, among others. *Communication Gap*: We were informed via email that carpets would be installed over the weekend. No update was provided when this changed. Carpet installation could lead to cosmetic damage that must be documented by Trinity Rose, and then verified once fixes are made. *Build Manager's Awareness*: Mark, your build manager, was not made aware of the agreed-upon two visits by Trinity Rose as specified in the reservation agreement. This lack of communication was not helpful for the purpose of this morning's visit. *Completion Date*: The date we have been able to arrange, taking into account removals and the door company's task, is the 25th October, which I have explained several times now. This is only four working days away from the end of the month, but is still by the end of the month, so is still within the *estimated *completion date entered into the reservation agreement by Crest. We have done what we can with the short notice, and despite the house not being ready for Trinity Rose yet, we have shown flexibility and willingness to have this sale completed as quickly as possible, raising issues as quickly as possible. *Trinity Rose's Next Steps:* They will perform a structural survey today, but two more visits will still be needed to complete their work as originally agreed. Given the multitude of issues and the urgency required, I request that *all* further communication regarding this sale be channelled through our solicitors.

The company can not be booked until we have a moving day, at which point they can confirm if they are available to remove them and fit them in the new property. This was discussed with the site and sales team a number of times. 2) Guttering - has it been cleared and cleaned? 3) Kitchen boxing - I spoke to the site team in the summer and raised an issue where the boxing is very clearly not square; as at the last visit, this still had not been rectified. This is something which was a major issue in our current house, and needs to be fixed before exchange. 4) Richard from Trinity Rose has now informed us that he can have someone visit the plot on Wednesday 11th, and has asked for confirmation that his costs will be covered for the time spent dealing with Adrian Sims, at a cost of \\u00a31500, and the plot 34 survey and report, for \\u00a32,500. I understand that this was supposed to have been a joint engagement with Trinity but Richard has confirmed that he has not had any contact from Crest. I have not been informed by Trinity what the cost for the second visit, if needed, would be. Regarding Trinity Rose's costs, it was agreed by Adrian Sims that the 2 surveys we had done with Trinity on the current house would be paid back to us. Please could you arrange to have those amounts paid to us on completion. The invoices have already been sent to Crest previously. 5) Please could you advise what the purpose of the visit from the 9th. would be for? 6) Have the CML and Stage 12 checks been carried out? These need to have been done and any issues fixed before Trinity visits.

To our concern, this has not happened. Moreover, our solicitors have made multiple unsuccessful attempts to communicate with Crest and its legal representatives in the past few weeks. I request that you urgently clarify the reasons for these delays. Additionally, please communicate with our solicitors tomorrow to explain the non-standard nature of the contract and provide a definite timeline for its delivery. Considering the house's current status, we should be apprised of a precise completion month. At present, we have only received a vague estimate of September or October. This clarity is essential for us to coordinate with Trinity Rose and ensure sufficient time for potential issue resolutions before we proceed to contract exchange.

Regarding the contract, please could you explain why this is non-standard, given this transaction is supposed to be separate from the buy back of 25 Abbots Road.

We do not have a month of completion, which is specified by the New Homes Ombudsman, only September or October.

Additionally, please communicate with our solicitors tomorrow to explain the non-standard nature of the contract and provide a definite timeline for its delivery. Considering the house's current status, we should be apprised of a precise completion month. At present, we have only received a vague estimate of September or October.

Key Issues: - Crest reneged on agreeing to pay Trinity Rose's fees which were clearly stated in my email to Natalie Haigh last week. - Lack of direct communication between Crest and Trinity Rose. - Unresponsiveness from Crest leading to delays. - Crest's failure to acknowledge issues in the build that may not meet NHBC standards. I have reiterated several times that Trinity Rose will not attend the site unless their fees are met. Despite receiving a confirmation email last week from Natalie Haigh at Crest agreeing to this, she has now backtracked. Paragraph 19, section a) clearly states that the surveyor will be instructed once the build is complete. The build is not complete, as their own internal survey is not being carried out until today, yet we have been pressured to get the surveyor booked in because they want to hit their targets, according to two of their sales agents. This is not a valid reason to only now rush the process. Richard Kirby from Trinity Rose needs confirmation by end-of-day today, or he will schedule another job for Wednesday. I have been proactive in chasing Crest on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, only receiving a reply at 19:45 last night. I asked for confirmation last week whether we do or do not need to find an alternative surveyor. Additionally, Natalie Haigh incorrectly claimed that Crest has instructed Trinity Rose. Richard Kirby has confirmed to me this morning that they have not been officially instructed, or had any communication from Crest whatsoever. I obviously can not do this for them. She also contested that the initial costs we covered for Trinity Rose were not agreed to be reimbursed, despite this being part of the Memorandum of Agreement. She has now agreed that it is of course covered. My reason for mentioning this is that they again need to be corrected or reminded. Crest also still needs to confirm their stance on the garage personnel doors, which impacts our scheduling with that company and, by extension, our potential completion date. Natalie Haigh promised a response to this but we have heard nothing. Due to these delays and lack of coordination from Crest, we are now obliged to opt for a full move service from our removal company, as reflected in the attached invoice.This is purely having the service agreed already by Crest in the agreement, so there is no basis for disagreement. Please could you contact Crest's solicitors urgently to address these issues and expedite the process, by having Crest contact Trinity to discuss payment, report generation time, and to confirm the visit on Wednesday.

For reference, this was never mentioned in the memorandum of agreement because we were not aware it until a couple of days ago. This may have been picked up earlier had Trinity been contacted by someone from Crest, since this was to be a joint engagement. I am concerned that the stage 12 has not been done yet. Even if your inspector finishes their report on Monday, only one day is left before our own surveyor is expected to visit, and for anything found by your stage 12 person to have been rectified and again checked by them. It is therefore unrealistic to expect that the house is ready to be moved into on Wednesday for our surveyor to visit. Please could you advise.

      "text": "\n\nBased on my comprehensive analysis of the email correspondence, here's a summary of the move-in date delays and Crest Nicholson's behaviour regarding Plot 34 / 10 Colt View:\n\n## **Timeline of Delays - Plot 34 Move-In Dates:**\n\n### **July 2023: Initial Phone Contact**\n- **July 17th**: Danielle Green from Crest called about mortgage status and informed you of the \"unusual nature\" of the sale, promising an amended contract \"the following week\"\n- This contract never materialized for weeks\n\n### **August 2023: First Major Delays**\n- **August 17th**: You complained that solicitors had been trying unsuccessfully to contact Crest for weeks\n- **August 30th**: Still no response from Crest on basic queries\n- You only had \"vague estimates of September or October\" for completion\n\n### **September 2023: Shifting to October**\n- **September 1st**: Natalie Haigh stated \"We are aiming for an October completion\"\n- **September 28th**: Crest finally said they were \"aiming to achieve CML this week\" and invited you to visit from October 9th\n- Packing materials ordered for early September in preparation\n\n### **October 2023: Pressure and More Delays**\n- **October 4th**: You complained they wanted you to \"move by the end of October to hit their sales targets\"\n- **October 5th**: Steve Smith asking when your survey was booked \"to enable completion by the end of October\"\n- **October 10th**: You pointed out \"25th October is only four working days until the end of the month\"\n\n### **November 2023: Extended Delays**\n- **November 8th**: You stated it was \"14 days since Crest received Trinity Rose's report\" with no response\n- **November 23rd**: Draft email mentioning you were \"almost a full calendar month since you advised the property would be ready to move in\"\n- References to your son's health issues and inability to tell him when you'd be settled\n\n### **December 2023: Finally Moving**\n- **December 18th**: Actual move-in day with key handover issues\n- You specifically stated \"We are supposed to have the keys at 1pm\" but completion hadn't occurred\n- Multiple emails about garage vs. house access during moving day\n\n## **Key Issues Demonstrating Poor Behaviour:**\n\n### **1. Repeated Broken Promises:**\n- Promised amended contract in July - not delivered for months\n- Multiple completion date estimates that kept shifting\n- Solicitor communication failures lasting weeks\n\n### **2. Sales Target Pressure:**\n- Direct admission from sales staff that they weren't allowed holidays in October\n- Pushing for completion by month-end for their targets, not customer convenience\n- Rushing the process despite incomplete internal inspections\n\n### **3. Poor Communication:**\n- Solicitors unable to reach Crest's legal team for weeks\n- Trinity Rose surveyor never contacted by Crest despite joint agreement\n- Multiple unanswered emails requiring repeated follow-ups\n\n### **4. Impact on Your Family:**\n- Having to contact your son's doctor about ongoing uncertainty\n- Boxes and packing materials ordered months in advance\n- Removal company costs increased due to Crest's delays and poor coordination\n\n### **5. Build Quality Issues:**\n- Stage 12 inspections not completed until the last minute\n- Kitchen boxing issues raised in summer still not fixed by October\n- Multiple items needing rectification that should have been caught earlier\n\nThe emails clearly show a pattern of Crest Nicholson making commitments they couldn't keep, shifting dates repeatedly, and putting their sales targets ahead of customer care - exactly the \"shocking behaviour\" you described.",

The case is now at a critical juncture with the NHOS Ombudsman.\n\nWould you like me to help you examine any specific emails or attachments from this list in more detail?",

On Thursday, 22nd May 2025, a certified structural surveyor arranged by Crest Nicholson (following my insistence on a professional assessment prior to any re-rendering work, and which was requested early 2024), attended my property. His initial findings are deeply concerning and dramatically alter the understanding of the defects: - *Not Settlement: *Within moments of inspecting the primary cracked wall, the surveyor stated unequivocally that the issue is not due to settlement. - *Probable Design/Construction Flaw:* His professional opinion is that the affected wall is likely too long and was constructed without a necessary compression joint. He indicated such a joint will now need to be installed, likely mid-wall, which will inevitably have a significant and negative aesthetic impact on a new property, an unacceptable outcome for a home of this age and supposed quality. - *Discovery of Further Cracks: *The surveyor also identified additional cracks on other external walls of the property, suggesting the issue may be more widespread than initially reported and not confined to one area. - *Anticipated Disruption & Mitigation: *Due to the extensive work (chipping off all render from all walls, and now the potential installation of a compression joint), the surveyor has already indicated he will be recommending that Crest Nicholson provide me with temporary office space for the duration of the works due to the inevitable extreme noise and disruption. - *Request for Specifications & Potential Delays: *The surveyor requires the original build specifications for this house type from Crest Nicholson to confirm the design requirements regarding compression joints. If Crest delays in providing this critical information, his final report and consequently the remedial works could be pushed significantly further out, potentially into Autumn 2025 when weather conditions for rendering become less favorable. This new information directly contradicts Crest Nicholson\\u2019s previous assertions that the issue was minor, \\\"cosmetic,\\\" or related to settlement. It also calls into serious question the adequacy of their initial \\\"visual inspection\\\" (which Crest Nicholson confirmed to the NHOS was conducted by a former employee and for which no report exists) and their subsequent handling of my complaint. Furthermore, Crest Nicholson's recent claim to the NHOS that they are working to 2014/2015 NHBC standards, but that they \\\"don't have a copy because it was so long ago,\\\" is now even more pertinent. Their inability to produce these standards, claiming it was \\\"so long ago\\\" despite this development being built under those very standards, coupled with these new structural findings, points to a potentially severe lapse in their quality control and adherence to building regulations at the time of construction. It is also pertinent to ask what standards Crest did follow if they cannot even produce the NHBC documents from the time of construction. I trust the NHOS will see these developments as critical new evidence. It reinforces that Crest\\u2019s agreement to re-render was not \\\"goodwill\\\" but a necessary response to a potentially significant defect they failed to identify or address appropriately for over a year. The scope of the problem and the required remediation (including an unsightly compression joint and temporary office space) now far exceed what was initially discussed, and further demonstrate that Crest's responses since this issue was first raised have reflected either deliberate attempts to avoid responsibility or a concerning lack of competence in the building trade. I urge the NHOS to: - Consider these findings in your ongoing investigation. - Press Crest Nicholson to provide the requested build specifications to the surveyor without any delay. - Recognise the escalating nature of the disruption and potential costs (e.g., office space) that are a direct result of Crest Nicholson's original failures. I will, of course, forward the surveyor's formal written report as soon as it becomes available, but it is likely I will have to chase for this report multiple times, so it will be easier for the NHOS to request this directly from Crest. Thank you for your urgent attention to this update. Kind regards, Paul Taylor\"}, \"parts\": []}, \"sizeEstimate\": 10490, \"historyId\": \"17372757\", \"internalDate\": \"1748352084000\"}",

Inspection Report: I am still waiting for a copy of the inspection report prepared by the staff member who visited my property. Please could I have this today. 2. NDA Consent: I would appreciate confirmation regarding Crest\\u2019s position on granting permission to discuss the 25 Abbots Road NDA in relation to my current situation. The NDA states: \\\"Mr and Mrs Taylor confirm and agree that they shall not disclose terms of this Memorandum of Agreement, nor the substance of all negotiations in connection with it, or otherwise communicate them, to any third party (without the written consent of Crest Nicholson, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) other than to their professional advisors on terms which preserve confidentiality or to the extent as may be required by law).\\\" Given this clause, I trust that any decision to withhold consent would not be made unreasonably, and a valid reason given that can be given to the NHOS. These matters are straightforward and can be resolved without delaying Mr. Clark\\u2019s comprehensive response. I look forward to your prompt reply so that I can update the complaint handler at the NHOS.

To help streamline things, I wanted to clarify that my two immediate requests are: 1. A copy of the inspection report for the render repair, so I can understand how it was deemed acceptable. 2. A decision regarding whether I can disclose the NDA-covered experience at 25 Abbots Road to the NHOS. I understand Mr. Clark is considering my email in full, but a swift response on these two points would greatly help in progressing matters. Thank you again for your assistance, and I look forward to hearing from you.

NDA Consent: I would appreciate confirmation regarding Crest\\u2019s position on granting permission to discuss the 25 Abbots Road NDA in relation to my current situation. The NDA states: \\\"Mr and Mrs Taylor confirm and agree that they shall not disclose terms of this Memorandum of Agreement, nor the substance of all negotiations in connection with it, or otherwise communicate them, to any third party (without the written consent of Crest Nicholson, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) other than to their professional advisors on terms which preserve confidentiality or to the extent as may be required by law).\\\" Given this clause, I trust that any decision to withhold consent would not be made unreasonably, and a valid reason given that can be given to the NHOS. These matters are straightforward and can be resolved without delaying Mr. Clark\\u2019s comprehensive response. I look forward to your prompt reply so that I can update the complaint handler at the NHOS.

To help streamline things, I wanted to clarify that my two immediate requests are: 1. A copy of the inspection report for the render repair, so I can understand how it was deemed acceptable. 2. A decision regarding whether I can disclose the NDA-covered experience at 25 Abbots Road to the NHOS. I understand Mr. Clark is considering my email in full, but a swift response on these two points would greatly help in progressing matters. Thank you again for your assistance, and I look forward to hearing from you.
