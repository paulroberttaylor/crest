# December 2023 Completion Crisis - Plot 34/10 Colt View

## Overview
This document details the catastrophic mismanagement of the property completion for Plot 34/10 Colt View by Crest Nicholson, which resulted in a 5-6 month delay, mortgage expiry threats, and significant financial and emotional stress for Paul and Jade Taylor.

## Timeline of Broken Promises

### Initial Promise vs Reality
- **June/July 2023**: Site manager's original completion promise
- **October 31, 2023**: Revised target date (Crest's preference)
- **December 18, 2023**: Actual completion date
- **Total Delay**: 5-6 months from original promise

## The October 2023 Date Conflict

### Critical Dates
- **October 24, 2023**: Solicitor confirms property "not ready" (7 days before planned completion)
- **October 25, 2023**: Paul's only available date - REFUSED by Crest
- **October 31, 2023**: Crest's insisted date for "end of year targets"
- **Difference**: Only 4 working days

### Evidence of Unreasonable Behavior
- 103 emails documenting the October date conflict
- No reasonable explanation provided for refusing October 25
- Crest prioritized internal targets over buyer availability
- Pattern of inflexibility despite causing the delays

## Mortgage Crisis

### Financial Impact
- **£999**: Mortgage broker fee (The Mortgage Workshop)
- **£1,495**: Mortgage arrangement fee
- **£7,000**: Redemption fee
- **£6,000**: Reduction in borrowing ability due to rate increases during delays

### Mortgage Expiry Timeline
- **June 6, 2023**: Rates increased, reducing borrowing by £6k
- **November 1-7, 2023**: Escalating concerns about mortgage expiry
- **November 2023**: 10 emails specifically about mortgage expiry fears
- **December 13, 2023**: Paul believes Crest deliberately delaying to force expiry

## Pattern of Urgent Communications

### Email Evidence
- **158**: Total urgent emails about completion
- **154**: Emails titled "URGENT: 10 Colt View"
- **36**: Emails in the main urgent thread
- **25**: Emails sent by Paul in urgent thread
- **10**: Responses from Crest (showing poor responsiveness)

### Key Crisis Points
- **December 13, 2023**: "URGENT - EXCHANGE" email showing last-minute panic
- **December 20, 2023**: Last possible completion day per solicitor
- Multiple instances of having to chase for basic responses

## Solicitor and Legal Issues

### Documentation Problems
- **472**: Emails involving solicitor/legal issues
- Contract described as "vastly different from standard"
- Missing documentation from Crest causing delays
- Trinity Rose certification issues

### Communication Failures
- Crest failing to respond to solicitor queries
- Paul having to intervene directly to get responses
- Pattern of Crest only responding to threats

## Impact on Both Buyers
- **8**: Relevant emails from Jade showing impact on both buyers
- Evidence of urgent payment issues with Trinity Rose assessment
- Both Paul and Jade affected by the delays and stress

## Key Violations

### New Homes Quality Code Breaches
1. **Part 2.1**: Failed to provide accurate completion timelines
2. **Part 3.4**: Poor complaints handling throughout process
3. **Principle 5**: Lack of responsiveness to urgent matters
4. **Part 2.5**: Failed to keep buyers informed of delays

### Pattern of Behavior
1. Making promises that weren't kept (June/July completion)
2. Refusing reasonable accommodation (October 25 date)
3. Prioritizing corporate targets over customer needs
4. Creating crisis situations through poor planning
5. Forcing buyers to send multiple urgent emails for responses

## Conclusion
The December 2023 completion represents a systematic failure by Crest Nicholson to manage the purchase process professionally. The 5-6 month delay from original promises, combined with the mortgage expiry crisis and pattern of poor communication, demonstrates a complete disregard for the financial and emotional wellbeing of their customers.

The evidence shows this wasn't mere incompetence but a pattern of prioritizing corporate interests (end of year targets) over customer needs, even when those customers were at risk of losing their mortgage and incurring significant additional costs.
