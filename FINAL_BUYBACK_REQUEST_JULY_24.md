# Final Buyback Request - July 24, 2025

**To: Martyn Clark, CEO**  
**CC: Mark Foyle, Charlie Joseph**  
**Date: July 24, 2025**  
**Subject: Confidential Resolution Following NHBC Confirmation**

Martyn,

This correspondence follows the receipt of conclusive evidence from the NHBC. We are now in possession of irrefutable, written proof of a systemic and indefensible breach of standards in the construction of our home.

This is a repeat of a previous situation our family was forced to endure. We are now offering you one final opportunity to resolve this matter privately and confidentially.

## The Indisputable Facts

We have documented proof of the following:

### 1. Systemic Breach of NHBC Standards (Admitted by Your Own Solicitor)
- The NHBC has confirmed in writing (July 23, 2025) that our property legally requires the 2022 NHBC Standards.
- Your Associate Company Solicitor, Helen Massey-Crow, has admitted in writing to the NHOS (May 13, 2025) that you built our home to the 2014 NHBC Standardsâ€”a standard that was 8 years out of date.
- The NHBC has confirmed "no permission has been given... to build using any NHBC Standards other than those applicable."

### 2. A Pattern of Documented Misrepresentation
Your executives repeatedly stated in writing that the property had "NHBC sign off." This is in direct contradiction to the NHBC's own formal position that "NHBC do not 'sign off' homes as defect free," indicating a serious failure in your internal processes and understanding of regulatory compliance.

### 3. Direct Culpability of Senior Management
On June 23, 2025, I emailed you personally with the MJA structural engineer's report proving the existence of structural defects. The subsequent delegated response to the NHOS continued to mischaracterize these structural issues as "cosmetic," "unnecessary," and a "gesture of goodwill," despite senior management's knowledge of the facts.

### 4. The NHOS Paradox: A Mandated Remedy that is Destructive
- The successful NHOS ruling now legally compels you to undertake structural work on our home.
- However, the render manufacturer, Saint-Gobain Weber, has confirmed in writing that the method required for this work is "very messy, very disruptive and very noisy" and will "undoubtable destroy" the face of the blockwork. Their expert assessment is that it will cause "more harm than good." Given this, we would need to understand your proposals for providing suitable alternative accommodation for our family during such works.

### 5. The Precedent and the Medically-Advised Resolution
- As you know, you previously actioned a buy-back of our former home due to the quantity of issues and the pragmatic decision to keep the matter out of the public eye.
- Your admission of using outdated NHBC standards suggests this issue may have affected all 66 properties on the Albany Wood development, a fact that would be of significant concern to all homeowners should it become public knowledge.

## Medical Impact and Professional Recommendation

Our family has now endured nearly four years of housing-related stress across two consecutive Crest Nicholson properties. Our son was 10 years old when we first moved into a Crest property. He will be 14 next month. His formative years have been overshadowed by construction defects, broken promises, and the stress of watching his parents fight for basic building standards.

This prolonged ordeal has necessitated ongoing medical intervention and support. Our GP, having observed the cumulative impact of:
- Fighting for basic building standards to be met across two properties
- Living with structural defects and uncertainty
- The repeated pattern of denial and delay
- The toll on our children during crucial developmental years

Is now preparing formal documentation explicitly recommending that our family be removed from this environment for our wellbeing. The medical advice is clear: this situation must end, and based on the precedent at 25 Abbots Road, a buyback represents the cleanest break for all parties.

The fact that we have been forced to seek medical support simply to have our home built to the correct standards is, in itself, a damning indictment of this process.

## The Inevitable Trajectory of Public Disclosure

You are now legally mandated to commence highly visible and destructive work on our home. Once this process begins, it creates a public chain of events that you cannot control.

When scaffolding is erected and our walls are cut into, our neighbours will naturally ask why. We will be under no obligation of confidentiality regarding this property and will answer them truthfully, with the supporting evidence. Once it becomes known that Crest Nicholson has admitted to building homes to outdated standards, it is reasonable to assume this will be of significant interest to other homeowners, housing journalists, and the trade press.

## The Only Path to a Private Resolution

A confidential buy-back of 10 Colt View is the only course of action that prevents this inevitable public disclosure. It is the only way to contain this crisis.

## Urgency and Final Resolution

We have identified a property to move to. Securing this is time-critical. If we cannot give the seller an assurance that we are proceeding, we will lose it. Should that happen, the primary incentive for a swift and private resolution will be removed.

Given the gravity and time-sensitivity, I require a direct telephone call from you, Martyn, personally, by 5:00 PM today, July 24, 2025, to discuss this resolution. My number is [PHONE NUMBER].

Should you wish not to engage in a conversation regarding this way out for both parties, we will of course accept the NHOS decision in full and accept the work to be carried out. We understand that the NHOS requires a program of works to be in place within 7 days of the final decision being made.

We look forward to your call.

Sincerely,

Paul Taylor
