Dear Mr. Clark,

The MJA Consulting report regarding 10 Colt View, which Crest Nicholson commissioned only at my insistence on a professional assessment, confirms what I have suspected and stated since January 2024: the render defects are not minor settlement, as Crest repeatedly asserted, but stem from fundamental construction issues.

For 18 months, my valid concerns about the cracking render were dismissed. Astonishingly, Crest Nicholson then agreed to a full re-render, framing it as a "gesture of goodwill," without any prior professional structural assessment to determine the root cause. Your company was seemingly prepared to undertake costly, disruptive work that, according to your own appointed experts (MJA Consulting), would likely fail again due to the lack of necessary movement joints.

This MJA report now irrefutably exposes that Crest Nicholson's proposed "goodwill" re-render, without addressing the underlying structural deficiencies, would have been a superficial fix, merely delaying the inevitable re-cracking and early failure of the render, quite possibly beyond the initial two-year warranty period that Crest would be responsible within. This is not "goodwill"; it appears to be a calculated attempt to avoid addressing a more serious and costly construction defect.

The report also highlights that Crest's initial "assessments" were incorrect. Your company's handling of this complaint has been characterized by neglect. This pattern of dismissing legitimate issues, only to propose inadequate solutions or concede under duress, is unacceptable and falls far short of the New Homes Quality Code. It proves my complaint was valid under NHOS guidelines from the outset over 500 days ago.

You, as the new CEO, and presumably aware of the history concerning our previous property, had the opportunity to ensure this was handled with competence and integrity. Instead, the approach has been one of consistent dismissal and attempts to downplay serious concerns. Claiming the house was built to NHBC standards while being unable to produce those standards for the NHOS further compounds this. You are ultimately responsible for this.

This MJA report, demonstrating the need for structural interventions like movement joints, and this correspondence, are being copied to the NHOS. It is clear evidence of Crest Nicholson's attempt to avoid proper rectification and their ongoing mismanagement.

Mr. Taylor
