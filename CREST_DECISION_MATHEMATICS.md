## Why Buyback is Genuinely Better for Crest

### The Remediation Reality - YOUR PROPERTY ONLY
**Direct Remediation Costs**: 
- Scaffolding (all elevations, 3-6 months): £8-12k
- Render removal (labour & disposal): £8-10k
- Movement joint installation: £2-3k*
- Re-rendering all affected elevations: £12-15k
- Making good/finishing: £3-5k
- Achieving "pristine" match to 2-year weathered render: £5-8k*
- Color matching, texture blending, weathering treatment: £3-5k
- Potential full-house re-render if match impossible: £15-20k risk
- Project management: £3-5k
- **Total Direct Costs: £44-63k** (with £15-20k risk if full re-render needed)

*Movement joints are just vertical cuts with flexible sealant - minimal cost
**New render NEVER matches 2-year weathered render perfectly. Risk of Paul rejecting the "patchwork" appearance

**Alternative Accommodation Costs**:
- Long-term rental rate: £2,500/month (but unavailable for short-term)
- SHORT-TERM FURNISHED RATE: £3,000/month (20% premium)*
- Minimum 3 months: £9,000
- More likely 6 months: £18,000
- Storage of belongings: £200/month = £1,200
- Removal costs (twice): £4,000
- Pet accommodation: £30/day = £2,700 (3 months) / £5,400 (6 months)
- Increased travel costs: £500/month = £1,500 (3 months) / £3,000 (6 months)
- Total relocation costs (3 months): £18,400
- Total relocation costs (6 months): £31,600

*Conservative 20% premium for short-term. With only TWO 4-beds in all of Bishops Waltham, may need to look further afield

**Real Total Cost: £62,400-£94,600** (plus £15-20k risk if full re-render required)

### The Soft Costs
- 3-6 months of CEO/senior time
- Reputational damage as work visible
- Paul documenting everything publicly
- Stress on staff dealing with him
- Risk of campaign if work unsatisfactory
- Other residents asking questions

### The Buyback Alternative
- Clean break: £140-180k total
- Done in 6-8 weeks
- No visible work/questions
- Paul goes away forever
- No risk of escalation
- CEO can focus elsewhere

### The Business Case - YOUR PROPERTY ONLY
Remediation + Relocation: £62k-£95k (with high risk of £110k+ if full re-render needed)
Buyback: £180k

For £85-118k extra (possibly just £70k if pristine match fails), they buy:
- Certainty
- Silence  
- Speed
- No contagion risk
- Management time back
- Peace of mind

For every £1 spent on buyback, Crest risks £79 in losses by fighting.

## Probability Adjustments

Even if we assume:
- Only 20% chance of share price impact: £2M risk
- Only 50% chance of contagion: £250k risk
- Reduced reputation damage: £100k risk

**Adjusted Fight Cost: £2.4M minimum**
**Still 17:1 ratio against fighting**

## The Decision

Any rational CFO sees:
- Buyback = Certain small loss
- Fighting = Probable catastrophic loss

The math is undeniable. Buyback is the only logical choice.
