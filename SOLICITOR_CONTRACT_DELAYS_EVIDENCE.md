**To:** Paul Taylor, Serhan Handani, Jade Taylor  
**Subject:** "RE: URGENT"  
**Critical Quote:** **"I do not believe we will be ready to complete on 31st October. We need the updated contract and full replies to the enquiries."**
- **Significance**: Just 7 days before Crest's demanded completion date
- **Shows**: Contract still not provided despite imminent deadline

### October 25 vs October 31 Dispute
- **Paul's position**: October 25 was his only available date
- **Crest's position**: Insisted on October 31 for "end of year targets"
- **Difference**: Just 4 working days
- **Result**: Crest wasn't ready on either date due to missing contract

### November 27, 2023 - Still No Contract
**From:** Hannah Rafferty  
**Subject:** "Purchase - Plot 34 Albany Wood"  
**Key Quote:** **"Once we have the amended contract and final documentation, how did you want to proceed?"**
- **Significance**: Nearly a month after failed October 31 completion
- **Shows**: Contract still not finalized

### December 12-13, 2023 - Exchange Obstruction and Solicitor's Bombshell
**The Final 48 Hours - A Pattern of Obstruction**

**December 12, 2023:**
- **2:56 PM**: Paul forwards urgent request: "Please respond to Hannah Rafferty, confirming that exchange will now happen"
- **3:55 PM**: Paul escalates: "Please confirm that exchange will happen before the end of business today. There is no reason for it to be delayed any further."
- **4:40 PM**: Paul again: "Our solicitors are still waiting to exchange. I would be grateful if they could be responded to with urgency."

**December 13, 2023:**
- **10:50 AM**: Paul to Eileen Guihen: "I would be very grateful if you could explain why exchange has still not happened"
- **11:54 AM**: Paul: "We are still waiting to exchange contracts. There is no reason for this to be delayed any longer."
- **12:19 PM**: Paul asks solicitor: "Are they breaching any of the several agreements' clauses?"
- **12:57 PM**: Hannah Rafferty's devastating response: **"At this point we think they are doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires. There's no other explanation."**
- **12:58 PM**: Hannah asks colleague to **"call the litigation solicitor"**

**Pattern**: Paul sent 6 urgent emails over 2 days just to achieve exchange, with Crest creating obstacles over already-agreed matters.

### December 13-14, 2023 - Frantic Last-Minute Exchange
Multiple "URGENT - EXCHANGE" emails show desperate efforts to complete before mortgage expiry

### December 18, 2023 - Finally Complete
Completion achieved 6 months after original promise

## Key Evidence Points

### 1. Duration of Contract Delays
- **Solicitor engaged**: May 2023
- **Contract needed for October 31**: Should have been ready by September
- **Contract still missing**: October 24, 2023
- **Contract issues ongoing**: November 27, 2023
- **Total delay**: 5+ months from when contract should have been ready

### 2. Impact of Contract Delays
- Failed October 31 completion date
- Mortgage rate increased due to delays
- Â£8,136.87 additional mortgage costs
- 4 months living among packed boxes
- Professional solicitor accused Crest of deliberate tactics

### 3. Pattern of Behavior
- Contract described as "vastly different from standard"
- Updated contract not provided when requested
- Watermark issues delaying finalization
- Contract amendments needed throughout November
- Solicitor had to repeatedly chase for documentation

### 4. Communication Failures
**"URGENT: 10 Colt View" Email Thread Analysis:**
- Paul sent: 25 emails
- Crest responded: 10 emails
- Ratio: 2.5:1 (Paul had to send 2.5 emails for each Crest response)

### NHOS Code Violation - September 1, 2023
**From:** Paul Taylor  
**To:** Danielle Green  
**Critical Quote:** **"We do not have a month of completion, which is specified by the New Homes Ombudsman, only September or October. Which month will the property be completed?"**
- **Significance**: Paul specifically cited NHOS requirements
- **Response**: Crest refused to provide a specific month
- **Code Violation**: NHOS Code section 2.7 requires specific month once building is weatherproof
- **Outcome**: Even the vague "September or October" proved false - completion was December 18

### Contract Promise Broken - July/August 2023
**July 17, 2023**: Danielle Green promised amended contract "the following week"  
**August 17, 2023**: Paul forced to chase: **"To our concern, this has not happened. Moreover, our solicitors have made multiple unsuccessful attempts to communicate with Crest."**
- **Pattern**: Promise made, promise broken, customer forced to chase

## Most Damning Evidence

### The Professional Assessment
Hannah Rafferty, a qualified solicitor, made the extraordinary statement that Crest was **"doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires."** This is not a casual accusation - it's a legal professional's assessment that Crest was intentionally sabotaging the purchase.

### The October 25 vs 31 Hypocrisy
Crest refused Paul's only available date (October 25) and insisted on October 31 for their "end of year targets" - a difference of just 4 working days. Yet they weren't ready on October 31 anyway due to the missing contract, proving their priorities were corporate targets, not customer readiness.

### The Timeline Impossibility
With solicitors engaged from May 2023 and a planned October 31 completion, Crest had over 5 months to prepare the contract. The fact it still wasn't ready by October 24 (7 days before completion) demonstrates either gross incompetence or deliberate obstruction.

## Conclusion
The email evidence shows a clear pattern of Crest failing to provide basic contractual documentation in a timely manner, leading directly to:
- Failed completion dates
- Increased mortgage costs
- Professional accusations of deliberate sabotage
- Months of additional stress and uncertainty

This wasn't a minor administrative delay - it was a fundamental failure that a professional solicitor believed was deliberate.
