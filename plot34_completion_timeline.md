## Summary of Delays

1. **Original Site Estimate:** June/July 2023
2. **First Delay:** Pushed to September/October 2023 (2-3 month delay)
3. **Second Delay:** Set for October 31, 2023
4. **Third Delay:** October 24 - confirmed not ready for October 31
5. **Final Completion:** December 18, 2023

**Total Delay:** Approximately 5-6 months from original estimate

## Reasons for Delays

1. **Contract Issues:**
   - Updated contract not provided by Crest in time
   - Contract amendments needed
   - "Vastly different from standard" contract concerns

2. **Documentation Delays:**
   - Full replies to enquiries not provided
   - Consent for proposed works needed
   - Redemption statement delays

3. **Other Issues:**
   - Fence/boundary concerns
   - Post-completion occupation terms
   - Various administrative delays

## Adrian Sims' "Ridiculous Excuse"
Referenced in October 11, 2023 email from Paul Taylor as "the ridiculous email I have just had from Natalie Haigh" - likely relating to why October 25 completion was "not achievable" despite only 4 working days difference from October 31.
