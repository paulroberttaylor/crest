## Timeline of Removal Company Disasters

### First Removal Company - Lost October 2023

**October 10, 2023**: Paul Taylor sends "Updated Removals Quote" to Natalie Haigh at Crest Nicholson
- This indicates removal company was already booked for expected October completion
- New quotes needed due to changing completion dates

**October 24, 2023**: Solicitor confirms "not ready" just 7 days before October 31 completion
- First removal company booking lost
- Original booking made based on Crest's promises

**October 31, 2023**: Planned completion date fails
- Removal company lost permanently
- Paul and Jade forced to find alternative at short notice

### Second Removal Company - December 2023 Crisis

**December 8, 2023**: Critical Email from Paul Taylor
> "Jade has spoken to the new removal company and they need payment up front 7 days before the move, therefore we must exchange this coming Monday, with Crest paying the invoice on Monday"

Key points:
- New removal company requires upfront payment (unusual requirement showing market conditions)
- Costs described as "a proper cost, given the short notice and proximity to Christmas"
- Premium pricing due to December/Christmas period

**December 13, 2023**: Threat of Losing Second Company
Paul Taylor's urgent warning:
> "If we do not exchange immediately, we will lose the second removals company, the first lost when the property was promised to be ready by the end of October. We have been advised by them that another customer has requested the date."

This shows:
- Active risk of losing second removal company
- Direct reference to first company already lost
- Competing demand for removal services near Christmas
- Crest's delays putting completion at risk again

**December 18, 2023**: Finally Completed
- Removal van arrives at 1:50 PM
- Not allowed into property until 4:27 PM
- 2.5+ hours of removal crew standing idle (additional hourly charges)

## Financial Impact

### Documented Costs
- **Note**: While significant costs were incurred due to premium Christmas period charges and rebooking fees, these were covered as part of a previous agreement with Crest Nicholson
- **Additional Factors**:
  - Short notice booking premium
  - Christmas period surcharge
  - Lost deposit on first company
  - Hourly charges for 2.5 hour wait on completion day

### Cost Breakdown Analysis
1. **Base removal cost**: Standard rate
2. **Short notice premium**: Due to December rebooking
3. **Christmas surcharge**: Peak period pricing
4. **Waiting time**: 2.5+ hours at hourly rate
5. **Lost deposit**: First company cancellation

### Crest's Acknowledgment
**December 21, 2023**: Serhan Handani references MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) stating Crest agreed to cover "removal costs" as part of expenses
- This confirms Crest accepted responsibility for removal costs
- Part of wider compensation for delays

## Pattern of Disrespect

### What This Shows
1. **Crest's promises meant nothing** - Families booked major life changes based on false dates
2. **No consideration for knock-on effects** - Lost removal bookings, premium costs
3. **Forced to pay premium prices** - Christmas period, short notice
4. **Risk of being homeless** - Nearly lost second removal company

### Human Impact
- Stress of potentially having nowhere to move belongings
- Embarrassment of cancelling professional services
- Financial pressure of upfront payments
- Uncertainty lasting months

## NHOS Code Violations

### Part 2.5 - Realistic Completion Dates
- Failed October 31 date caused first removal company loss
- December date nearly caused second loss
- Families cannot plan major life events

### Part 2.2 - Delays and Compensation
- Additional costs incurred due to delays
- Premium pricing forced on buyers
- No proactive compensation offered

### Principle 1 - Fairness
- Buyers bearing cost of developer's failures
- Forced into premium Christmas period bookings
- Risk of homelessness due to completion failures

## Conclusion

The loss of two removal companies and associated costs is emblematic of Crest Nicholson's complete disregard for the human impact of their failures. Families plan their entire lives around moving dates - booking time off work, arranging childcare, coordinating services. When Crest breaks these promises, the cascade of consequences falls entirely on the buyer.

Paul and Jade Taylor were forced to:
1. Cancel their first removal company (losing any deposit)
2. Book at premium Christmas rates
3. Pay upfront due to being "high risk" customers
4. Nearly lose their second booking
5. Pay for 2.5 hours of idle time on completion day

While the financial costs were covered in a previous agreement, this evidence demonstrates a company that treats its customers' major life events as inconveniences to their corporate scheduling.
