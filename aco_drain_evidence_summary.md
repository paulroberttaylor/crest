## Critical Information
1. The ACO drain was installed as part of remedial work following Trinity Rose's initial October 2023 inspection

3. The site manager confirmed to Trinity Rose that:
   - The ACO run is **solid with no perforation**
   - It connects to the downpipe located between the house and garage
4. This was a response to issues identified in Trinity Rose's initial report about DPC and ground levels
