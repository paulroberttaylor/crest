Vacant possession will be required and all keys for 25 Abbots Road will need to be provided to our sales executive at Albany Wood by 12.30 on the 3rd day.\r\n\r\nAs I advised in my email dated 5th December we are happy to agree (subject to contract) a completion date of 18th  December 2023, on the proviso that all items in the memorandum of agreement have been met.\r\n\r\nAs per point 4 of the memorandum of agreement, and in particular 4.2 which is required at exchange and point 4.3 which is require prior to completion.  Regarding 4.2, draft wording has been sent to your solicitor and we await confirmation that the proposed wording is agreed.   Please can you ask you solicitors to confirm agreement by return.\r\n\r\nRegarding the meeting at plot 34 Albany Wood on Sunday 3rd December, this was for you to view the property only and was not a snagging visit. Had you wanted to carry out a snagging survey this would have needed to be done by prior appointment and undertaken by a RICS or other suitably qualified surveyor, as per the NHQB rules, and paid for by yourselves.\r\n\r\nI am aware that our sales executive, Lynn Carrington, carried out a snagging report during that meeting, however this was not the intention of the visit and the report is for Crest use only and we do not intend to share with yourselves. The site team have already completed the majority of the items and most, if not all, will be completed prior to legal competition.\r\n\r\nWe cannot confirm, as you are requesting, that there will be no snagging items outstanding when you complete.

      "As per point 4 of the memorandum of agreement, and in particular 4.2 which is required at exchange and point 4.3 which is require prior to completion.  Regarding 4.2, draft wording has been sent to your solicitor and we await confirmation that the proposed wording is agreed.   Please can you ask you solicitors to confirm agreement by return.\r\n\r\nRegarding the meeting at plot 34 Albany Wood on Sunday 3rd December, this was for you to view the property only and was not a snagging visit. Had you wanted to carry out a snagging survey this would have needed to be done by prior appointment and undertaken by a RICS or other suitably qualified surveyor, as per the NHQB rules, and paid for by yourselves.\r\n\r\nI am aware that our sales executive, Lynn Carrington, carried out a snagging report during that meeting, however this was not the intention of the visit and the report is for Crest use only and we do not intend to share with yourselves. The site team have already completed the majority of the items and most, if not all, will be completed prior to legal competition.",

Please could you also confirm that a Pickett fence is no longer required, as per previous emails from your solicitor ?<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n\r\n  1.

      "Good afternoon,<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\nPlease could I have an update on the visit on Sunday.  This is urgent. <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\nMultiple items throughout the house were found, which were shown to Crest's representatives, including another issue with the DPC.<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>",
      "Our son has had another doctors appointment and is now suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\nThe visit on Sunday was supposed to be exciting for him, yet dozens more issues were found, when the property was supposed to have been signed off by the build manager, as well as a stage 12 inspector.<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\nI need an urgent response, as we were told that the house would be ready by the end of October and we are fast approaching Christmas.<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>",
      "I need an urgent response, as we were told that the house would be ready by the end of October and we are fast approaching Christmas.<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\nInstead, history has repeated itself. Adrian Sims promised us that there would be no repeat of 25 Abbots Road. <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>\r\n <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/south-and-yorkshire-team>",
      "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nTrinity Rose's director was present in the calls with Adrian Sims because Trinity Rose would be engaged by Crest to carry out the checks on the works for 25 Abbots Road.\r\n\r\nAt no point were we advised that this time would be invoiced retrospectively, and has no bearing on the report for 10 Colt View. Our only involvement is that we are purchasing 10 Colt View. Crest engaged Trinity Rose to carry out the checks, to produce the original report of issues, and the second report to confirm if all items had been rectified."
