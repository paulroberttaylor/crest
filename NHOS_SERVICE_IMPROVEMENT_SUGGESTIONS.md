# NHOS Service Improvement Suggestions
*Based on Experience with Case NHOS-2024-000512*

## 1. Health Impact Fast-Track System

### Confidential Health Disclosure
- Add confidential section to complaint forms for vulnerability/mental health disclosure
- Create triage system to prioritize cases with documented health impacts
- Recognize "breaking point" situations from cumulative property stress
- Consider emergency escalation path when customers show crisis indicators

### Mental Health Support
- Provide list of support services (Mind, Samaritans, etc.) during long waits
- Include warning about potential stress of lengthy process
- Offer check-in calls for vulnerable customers
- Acknowledge that 8+ month waits can push people to crisis

## 2. NDA Override Powers

### Regulatory Exemption
- Seek governmental approval for NDAs to not apply to NHOS investigations
- Enable pattern detection across properties hidden by confidentiality
- Override "commercial sensitivity" when public safety involved
- Prevent builders weaponizing NDAs to hide systemic failures

### Current Problem
- Builders can refuse NDA discussion "without giving reasons"
- Previous property issues provide crucial context but can't be discussed
- Patterns of behavior hidden behind legal walls
- Homeowners forced to fight each property in isolation

## 3. Mandatory Apology Standards

### Required Elements
- **Acknowledge specific failures**: "We failed to identify movement joints were required"
- **Accept responsibility**: "This was our error, not a misunderstanding"
- **No deflection**: "We apologize for..." not "We're sorry you feel..."
- **Acknowledge delay harm**: "We should have arranged for a structural surveyor in January 2024, not made you fight for 18 months"
- **Address competency**: "Non-technical staff should not have made claims about technical issues"
- **Commit to change**: "We will train staff on NHBC requirements"

### Example Template
"We apologize for:
- Failing to properly construct your property with required movement joints
- Dismissing your legitimate structural concerns as cosmetic for 18 months
- Having non-technical staff make incorrect claims about technical matters
- Refusing to arrange proper professional assessment when first requested
- The significant distress and health impact this caused your family

We accept full responsibility for these failures and will implement training to prevent recurrence."

## 4. Technical Accuracy in Decisions

### Language Standards
- Mandatory technical review of terms like "superficial"
- Context requirements - if something "may lead to failure," must state this
- No minimizing language that inadvertently validates builder denials
- Clear distinction between "current state" and "future risk"

### Example Fix
Instead of: "The cracks are superficial"
Write: "While the cracks don't currently affect structural integrity, the engineer confirms they will accelerate degradation and lead to early failure of the protective render system without proper remediation"

## 5. Builder Accountability

### Public Performance Data
- Annual "report cards" showing complaint patterns
- Response time tracking (public shame for delayers)
- "Best practice" examples of builders handling issues well
- Pattern detection across multiple complaints

### Systemic Pattern Recognition
- Flag phrases like "cosmetic," "goodwill," "unnecessary" as potential minimization
- Track builder tactics (delay, deny, deflect)
- Identify builders repeatedly using same failed arguments
- Public reporting of builders using outdated standards

## 6. Process Improvements

### Communication
- Case-specific email addresses (not general inbox)
- Milestone updates even if just "still reviewing"
- Expected timeline guidance upfront
- Portal for document upload with confirmation

### Evidence Management
- Clear evidence checklist at start
- What makes a strong case vs weak case
- Confirmation of all documents received
- Structured way to submit ongoing evidence

### Post-Decision
- Clear follow-up mechanism for non-compliance
- Structured feedback survey while experience fresh
- Annual review of whether decisions led to actual change

## 7. Complaint Creation Process

### Portal Functionality
- **Multiple complaints capability** - Some customers have several unrelated issues
- **Clear guidance** on what constitutes one complaint vs multiple
- **Save and return** function for complex complaints
- **Document attachment** during initial submission

### Customer Service Standards
- **Empathy training** for phone operators - customers are often at breaking point
- **"No wrong door" policy** - help customers even if they're confused about process
- **Trauma-informed approach** - recognize NHOS is often last resort
- **Clear escalation path** if operators can't help

### Real Example
"I had two unrelated claims but was told I couldn't raise both. When I tried to explain why this wasn't logical, the phone operator was quite rude. The NHOS is the last place people can turn to - they need to feel supported, not like they're wasting the operator's time."

## 8. Technical Knowledge Requirements

### Staff Training
- **NHBC standards training** for all claims handlers and ombudsmen
- **Understanding of key terms** (e.g., "superficial" vs "structural protection failure")
- **Regular updates** on building standards changes
- **Technical advisor pool** for complex cases

### Why This Matters
- Prevents missing subtle but crucial distinctions
- Reduces need for customer corrections post-decision
- Builds confidence in technical competence
- Avoids inadvertently supporting builder narratives

### Example
"I had to go back to Nigel about the 'superficial' wording because it missed the crucial distinction between current structural integrity and future protective system failure - something someone familiar with NHBC standards would have caught."

## 9. Builder Claims Verification Checklist

### Mandatory Information for Technical Claims
- **Who made the claim** - Name and job title
- **Their qualifications** - Are they qualified to assess structural issues?
- **Date of claim** - When did they make this assessment?
- **Evidence provided** - Did they provide technical backing?
- **Site visit conducted** - Did they actually inspect or just email?

### Red Flags to Track
- **Customer service reps making technical claims** about structural issues
- **Sales staff dismissing defects** as "normal" or "cosmetic"
- **Managers overruling technical staff** without qualifications
- **Claims made without site visits** or professional assessment

### Example from This Case
"Crest had non-technical staff claiming render cracks were 'cosmetic' and 'settlement' for 18 months. Only when forced to hire a structural engineer was the truth revealed - missing movement joints. A simple checklist would have exposed that unqualified staff were making technical judgments."

### Suggested Implementation
- Builder must declare qualifier's credentials for any technical claim
- NHOS flags when customer service makes structural assessments  
- Automatic escalation if technical claims lack qualified backing
- Track patterns of builders using unqualified staff to dismiss defects

### Immediate Evidence Requirement
- **Builder claims "settlement"** → "Provide structural report confirming settlement NOW"
- **Builder claims "cosmetic"** → "Provide qualified assessment proving no structural impact NOW"
- **Builder claims "normal"** → "Provide NHBC standards showing this is acceptable NOW"
- **Builder claims "unnecessary work"** → "Provide technical evidence supporting this NOW"

### Power Dynamic Shift
- Puts builders on defensive immediately
- No more 18-month delays hoping customers give up
- Can't make claims without immediate proof
- Exposed if they've been bluffing without evidence

### Example Script
"You claim this is settlement. Please provide within 7 days:
1. Structural engineer's report confirming settlement
2. Evidence ruling out construction defects
3. Qualification details of person making assessment
Failure to provide this evidence will be taken as admission that your claim is unsubstantiated."

## 10. Technology Enhancement - Salesforce AgentForce Integration

### AI-Powered Case Analysis
- **Pattern detection** across builder responses (e.g., "cosmetic" claims without evidence)
- **Timeline analysis** - flag cases with excessive delays or customer chase patterns
- **Evidence gap detection** - identify missing technical backing automatically
- **Similar case matching** - find precedents instantly

### Automated Builder Accountability
- **Claim verification** - AI prompts for evidence when builders make technical assertions
- **Qualification checking** - flag when unqualified staff make technical claims
- **Response tracking** - automatic alerts when builders miss deadlines
- **Escalation triggers** - identify cases needing urgent attention

### Ombudsman Support Tools
- **Draft decision assistance** - ensure consistent technical language
- **NHBC standards reference** - instant lookup during case review
- **Red flag summaries** - highlight concerning patterns in builder behavior
- **Evidence weighting** - help assess strength of technical claims

### Customer Experience
- **Intelligent case updates** - proactive communication at key milestones
- **Document assistant** - help customers understand what evidence to provide
- **Mental health indicators** - flag language suggesting customer distress
- **Timeline predictions** - realistic expectations based on case complexity

### Example Implementation
"AgentForce detects: Builder claimed 'settlement' 3 times over 6 months without providing evidence. Pattern matches 47 other cases where builder delayed until forced to commission reports. Recommended action: Immediate evidence demand with 7-day deadline."

## 11. Major Defect Classification System

### Automated Major Defect Recognition
- **Salesforce checkbox**: "Could this lead to a warranty claim?"
- **If checked**: Automatically flags as "Major Defect" per Code definition
- **Decision template**: Auto-populates language about major defect
- **Override builder characterization**: Regardless of how builder described it

### Implementation
- Simple checkbox on complaint record: "Potential warranty claim?"
- If YES → System flags: "This constitutes a Major Defect under Code definition"
- Decision must include: "This complaint involves a Major Defect as defined by the Code"
- Prevents builders minimizing structural issues as "cosmetic"

### Example from My Case
- Crest called it: "cosmetic," "settlement," "unnecessary"
- Reality: Missing movement joints = warranty claim = Major Defect
- 18 months of mischaracterization could have been prevented
- One checkbox would have flagged this immediately

### Benefits
- Consistent application of Code definitions
- Prevents builder minimization tactics
- Clearer decisions for homeowners
- Pattern tracking of major defects by builder

## 12. Policy Influence

### Government Liaison
- Regular reports on systemic issues found
- Recommendations for regulatory change
- Highlight conflicts of interest (NHBC funded by builders)
- Push for mandatory independence of inspectors

### Industry Change
- Use cases like mine to drive NHBC standard updates
- Highlight when "2014 standards on 2023 build" happens
- Push for real-time standard compliance checking
- Address "marking own homework" problem

## Summary

The NHOS provides a vital service, but improvements in health support, NDA handling, apology standards, and technical accuracy would prevent the secondary harm that comes from fighting legitimate complaints. My case shows how builder intransigence combined with lengthy processes can push families to breaking point - something the service improvements above would help prevent.
