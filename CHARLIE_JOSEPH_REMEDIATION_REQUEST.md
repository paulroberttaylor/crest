# Remediation Plan Request - Charlie Joseph

**To**: charlie.joseph@crestnicholson.com
**Subject**: Remediation Plan Required - NHOS Decision NHOS-2024-000512
**Send**: Monday 9am (same time as CEO/Chairman email)

Dear Mr Joseph,

Following the NHOS decision requiring structural remediation at 10 Colt View, I require a comprehensive remediation plan addressing all aspects of the work.

## 1. Scope and Timeline
- Complete scope of render removal (all elevations affected)
- Movement joint installation methodology for both brick and blockwork
- Re-rendering specifications and materials
- Firm start and completion dates for each phase
- Contingency plans for issues discovered during render removal (as your surveyor noted)
- Names of ALL subcontractors who will perform this work
- Direct contact details for the owner/director of each contracting company
- Confirmation that I will meet with each contractor's senior management before work commences to review the pristine finish requirements and agree quality standards
- Confirmation that I will inspect all exposed blockwork after render removal to verify absolutely no damage exists before any further work proceeds

## 2. Property Protection
- How you will achieve zero render debris in our garden and surrounding landscape
- Protection measures for windows, doors, and landscaping
- Security measures for the vacant property
- Regular property inspection schedule during our absence

## 3. Quality Assurance
- Named site manager and contact details
- Inspection points and sign-off process
- How "pristine finish" will be defined and achieved
- Warranty terms for the completed work
- Process for addressing any defects

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: I require a written guarantee BEFORE work commences that the finished work will appear pristine - as if movement joints had been correctly installed during original construction. This means:
- No visible vertical lines in brickwork where joints are cut
- No color variation between original and disturbed masonry
- No visible sealant lines or cover plates
- Perfectly matched mortar in all affected areas
- Render that shows no evidence of retrofit work
- The property must appear as if built correctly from day one

Please explain specifically how you will achieve this given that:
- Movement joints require cutting through brick faces, not at mortar joints
- Natural perp joint drift means vertical mortar joints don't align between courses
- During construction, movement joints are planned at specific perp positions
- Retrofit cuts cannot follow the natural zigzag of perp joints - must cut straight through
- This means cutting through random positions on bricks - some near edges, some through centers
- Any damaged bricks requiring replacement will be obvious (new vs 2-year weathered)
- Fresh mortar pointing will never match existing weathered mortar
- The vertical cuts cannot follow the brick bonding pattern as they would during construction

I need to understand how you propose to make retrospective cuts through existing brickwork appear identical to joints that would have been carefully planned and built into the structure from day one. To be absolutely clear: visible vertical scars, obvious retrofit lines, or any appearance that makes our home look like it has undergone major structural repairs will be completely unacceptable.

Given that movement joints require 10-15mm gaps (versus 10mm mortar joints), I need to understand your approach for:

**Ground Floor (Exposed Brickwork):**
- How will you cut through brick faces without ANY visible damage, chips, or cracks?
- How will you handle perp drift preventing cuts at natural mortar joints?
- What is your contingency when bricks inevitably chip or crack during cutting?
- How will you achieve perfectly straight cuts through random brick positions?
- Any damage to exposed brickwork cannot be hidden and will be permanently visible

**First Floor (Rendered Blockwork):**
- Less critical as it will be re-rendered, but still requires structural integrity

**Structural Integrity Concerns:**
- How will you determine the exact location of all wall ties prior to cutting to ensure none are severed?
- If any wall ties are inadvertently cut, what is your remediation plan?
- Given our south and west elevations face open fields with no wind protection and experience maximum thermal expansion, how will you guarantee structural stability after potentially severing wall ties?
- What liability insurance covers potential outer leaf movement or failure following your work?
- Industry guidance warns that severed ties can lead to "bulging, bowing, or outward collapse of the outer leaf"
- Can you guarantee with 100% certainty that both elevations will remain structurally sound after cutting retrospective joints through random brick positions and potentially severing unknown wall ties?

I require your detailed plan addressing these specific challenges within 5 working days. Any visible damage, poor cutting, or evidence of retrofit work on the exposed ground floor brickwork will be unacceptable and require complete remediation at Crest's expense.

If the work fails to meet this standard, you must guarantee IN ADVANCE that:
- All work will be redone at Crest's expense
- Alternative accommodation costs continue during rework
- An independent surveyor and I will jointly determine if the "pristine" standard is met
- No arbitrary deadlines - work continues until standard achieved

## 4. Health and Safety
- Full risk assessments
- Scaffold safety certifications and inspection schedule
- Site security measures
- Emergency procedures

## 5. Environmental Considerations
- Waste disposal methods
- Protection of neighboring properties
- Restoration of any damaged landscaping
- Written notification to all adjacent neighbors before work commences, including:
  - Full scope of structural remediation work
  - Reason for extensive retrofit work (missing movement joints)
  - Expected duration (noting uncertainty)
  - Direct Crest contact for any damage claims or complaints
  - Acknowledgment that silica dust from cutting may affect their properties

## 6. Alternative Accommodation Requirements
Given the scale of work - complete render removal from all elevations, diamond cutting through load-bearing walls, potential wall tie remediation, silica dust generation, and unknown structural investigations - the property will be uninhabitable throughout. Expecting a family to live through such hazardous work, particularly after your failures necessitated it, would be unconscionable. Therefore, please detail:
- What suitable 4-bedroom property have you identified for our family of three?
- How will you ensure it's within our son's school catchment area?
- How do you plan to secure accommodation in Bishops Waltham's limited rental market?
- How will you maintain security at our vacant property?
- That accommodation will be secured BEFORE any work commences
- Duration of accommodation rental sufficient for the entire project with flexible extensions
- Coverage of all associated costs: removals (twice), storage, increased travel, utilities at both properties
- Compensation for the significant disruption of relocating our family twice

**CRITICAL**: Since you cannot know what issues lie beneath the render until removal, accommodation must be secured for the full duration of works with flexible extensions as needed. Your own surveyor warned additional issues may be found.

Please also confirm:
- Who has authority to approve variations if additional work is required
- How you will manage the open-ended nature of this project

I require this comprehensive plan within 5 working days (by close of business Monday 29 July 2025) to understand the full impact on my family. No work, including scaffolding erection, may commence until I have reviewed and approved your comprehensive plan and all guarantees are agreed in writing. This timeline is necessary given the urgency of the NHOS-mandated remediation.

Given our previous experiences with Crest's quality control, where 50+ defects were missed despite "15 inspections" and a final Stage 12 sign-off, I trust you understand my need for detailed assurances.

These requirements are not unreasonable - they simply reflect the standard that should have been achieved during original construction. After 18 months of denial about major defects, a broken promise that there would be "no repeat of 25 Abbots Road," and your admission of using 2014 standards on our 2023 build, I am entitled to ensure any remedial work meets the highest standards. The alternative is accepting substandard work on an already compromised property, which no reasonable homeowner would do.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Taylor
