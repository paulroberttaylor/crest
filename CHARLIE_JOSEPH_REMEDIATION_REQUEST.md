# Remediation Plan Request - Charlie Joseph

**To**: charlie.joseph@crestnicholson.com
**Subject**: Remediation Plan Required - NHOS Decision NHOS-2024-000512
**Send**: Monday 9am (same time as CEO/Chairman email)

Dear Mr Joseph,

Following the NHOS final decision requiring structural remediation at 10 Colt View, I require a comprehensive remediation plan addressing all aspects of the work.

Given that I work from home and our son will be home during school holidays, please provide detailed information on:

## 1. Scope and Timeline
- Complete scope of render removal (all elevations affected)
- Movement joint installation methodology for both brick and blockwork
- Re-rendering specifications and materials
- Firm start and completion dates for each phase
- Contingency plans for issues discovered during render removal (as your surveyor noted)

## 2. Disruption Management
- Noise levels expected (in decibels) during each phase
- Working hours and days
- Dust mitigation measures
- How you will achieve zero render debris in our garden
- Protection measures for windows, doors, and landscaping

## 3. Quality Assurance
- Named site manager and contact details
- Inspection points and sign-off process
- How "pristine finish" will be defined and achieved
- Warranty terms for the completed work
- Process for addressing any defects

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: I require a written guarantee BEFORE work commences that the finished render will appear pristine - as if movement joints had been correctly installed on December 18, 2023. This means:
- No visible patches or color variations
- No texture differences between old and new render
- No visible lines where new meets old
- Uniform weathering appearance across all elevations
- Indistinguishable from original installation

If the work fails to meet this standard, you must guarantee IN ADVANCE that:
- All work will be redone at Crest's expense
- Alternative accommodation costs continue during rework
- If pristine match proves impossible, full property re-render will be completed
- I have sole discretion to determine if "pristine" standard is met
- No arbitrary deadlines - work continues until standard achieved

## 4. Health and Safety
- Full risk assessments
- Scaffold safety certifications and inspection schedule
- Site security measures
- Emergency procedures

## 5. Environmental Considerations
- Waste disposal methods
- Protection of neighboring properties
- Restoration of any damaged landscaping

## 6. Living Arrangements During Works
- How will we access the property with scaffolding on all elevations?
- Where will we park with the driveway blocked by scaffolding/equipment?
- How can our son safely play in the garden with scaffolding and debris risks?
- What provisions for basic amenities (bins, deliveries, emergency access)?
- How will you ensure windows can open for ventilation in summer?
- Security concerns with scaffolding providing access to upper floors
- Impact on home insurance with scaffolding present

## 7. Daily Life Disruption
- How do we maintain any quality of life during months of work?
- Working from home with 100+ decibel noise levels
- Video calls impossible with grinding/drilling
- Dust ingress despite windows closed in summer heat
- Mental health impact of living on a construction site
- Pet safety with constant contractor access

## 8. Uncertainty and Duration
Given your surveyor's statement that full scope cannot be determined until render removal:
- How can you provide any meaningful timeline?
- What if structural issues require exclusive occupation?
- At what point would the property become uninhabitable?
- What triggers the need for alternative accommodation?
- Who determines if we can safely remain during work?

**CRITICAL**: Since you cannot know what issues lie beneath the render until removal, you must:
- Secure alternative accommodation for MINIMUM 6 months with flexible extension options
- Build in contingency for ANY discovered problems (structural damage, water ingress, insulation issues)
- Guarantee accommodation continues until ALL work completed to pristine standard
- Accept that "3 months" is meaningless when scope is unknown
- Prepare for potential 9-12 month project if complications arise

Your own surveyor warned additional issues may be found. You cannot reasonably expect us to move back mid-project if serious defects are discovered.

Please also confirm:
- Who has authority to approve variations if additional work is required
- How you will manage the open-ended nature of this project
- Compensation arrangements for the unknown disruption period
- Alternative accommodation provisions must assume WORST CASE scenario
- Your position if we determine the property is uninhabitable during works

As the courts have established, relocation is required when repairs "cannot reasonably be carried out while in occupation" or when "exclusive occupation is essential." Given the unknown scope, how can you guarantee this won't be necessary?

## 9. Relocation Provisions
Should the work require us to vacate (which seems increasingly likely given the scope), please detail:
- What suitable alternative accommodation will be provided for a family of three?
- How will you ensure it's in the same school catchment area?
- Who covers removal and storage costs for our belongings?
- What happens to our pets during displacement?
- How will you maintain security at our vacant property?
- Who pays increased costs (utilities, council tax, travel)?
- What if the work extends beyond initial estimates?
- Compensation for the upheaval of relocating twice?

Given that you cannot determine the scope until render removal begins, prudent planning requires addressing these relocation logistics now.

**TIME-CRITICAL**: We have already identified a suitable property that would meet our family's needs during displacement. However, in Bishops Waltham's extremely limited rental market (only 2 four-bedroom properties total), this will not remain available. If Crest intends to proceed with remediation requiring relocation, you must:
- Confirm within 48 hours of receiving this email
- Authorize immediate rental deposit and secure the property
- Accept that delay means losing this option and facing even higher costs
- Understand that suitable alternatives may not exist locally

The alternative is paying significantly more for inferior accommodation outside our area, disrupting our son's schooling and our work.

I note that NHBC Buildmark insurance covers "reasonable costs of removal and storage of possessions and alternative accommodation" when homes become uninhabitable due to building work. Given the scale of proposed work - complete render removal from all elevations, structural movement joint installation, and unknown additional requirements - please confirm:
- At what point you will declare the property uninhabitable?
- How you will coordinate with NHBC for accommodation claims?
- Whether Crest will cover costs beyond NHBC policy limits?

I require this comprehensive plan within 14 days to understand the full impact on my family before work commences.

Given our previous experiences with Crest's quality control, where 50+ defects were missed despite "15 inspections," I trust you understand my need for detailed assurances.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Taylor
