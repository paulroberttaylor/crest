# Email to Mark Nelson - NHBC

Good afternoon Mr Nelson,

I would be very grateful for a response to these points while your investigation is being carried out.  

I have just been informed by the NHOS that my complaint has been upheld. They have ordered the builder to carry out their own structural engineer's recommendations, which include investigating the lack of movement joints that the engineer identified as a likely cause of the render cracking.

This reinforces my concerns about:
1. The builder using 2014 standards for a 2023 build
2. The builder characterizing missing movement joints as "cosmetic" for 18 months
3. A professional builder not identifying basic NHBC requirements without customer intervention

I would hope the NHBC's response will confirm that:
- 2014 standards are not appropriate for a house built in 2023
- Movement joints are required under NHBC standards for walls exceeding 6000mm
- Such requirements should be known to any competent builder

Many thanks,
Paul
