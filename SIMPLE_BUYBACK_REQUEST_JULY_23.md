# Buyback Request - 10 Colt View

**Subject: Request for Buyback - 10 Colt View**

Dear Martyn, Mark and Charlie,

I received a letter from NHBC today confirming that our property should have been built to 2022 standards, not the 2014 standards your legal team confirmed were used.

Additionally, Weber has advised that the NHOS-mandated render work would cause significant damage to the property.

Given:
- The previous buyback at 25 Abbots Road
- The ongoing impact on my family's wellbeing (now approaching 4 years)
- The complexity of the required remediation work
- Our GP's recommendation that we should not continue living in this situation

I believe a buyback of 10 Colt View would be the most sensible solution for all parties, as it was before.

Could you please confirm by 5pm today whether Crest would be willing to discuss this option?

Kind regards,

Paul Taylor
