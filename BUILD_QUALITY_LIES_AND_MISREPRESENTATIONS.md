# Build Quality Lies and Misrepresentations
## Plot 34/10 Colt View - A Pattern of Deception

### Overview
This document details the systematic misrepresentations made by Crest Nicholson regarding the build quality and inspection of Plot 34 (10 Colt View). Despite claims of thorough checks, the property had 45 defects on completion day and critical safety issues that Paul Taylor had to identify himself.

## The Big Lies

### 1. The "15 Checks" Deception

#### The Claim
**Build Manager via Trinity Rose**: Property checked "approximately 15 times" plus Stage 12 inspection

#### The Reality
**45 defects found on January 4, 2024**, including:
- Water damage to dishwasher door
- Tapping noise in mega flow
- Settlement cracks in multiple rooms
- Garage DPC and water leakage
- Guttering full of debris
- Grass laid on top of grass
- Multiple door and window issues

#### The Admission
**October 17, 2023** - Paul Taylor reveals:
> "This is the same build manager who told me I probably know more about the NHBC standards than himself"

#### The Evidence
**November 23, 2023** - Paul confronts Natalie Haigh:
> "I am incredibly disappointed that we were informed that the build manager, via Trinity Rose, had checked the property approximately 15 times, and that there has also been a Stage 12 inspection, yet there were many items found which meant the property was not in a state to move in to."

### 2. The Gutter Cleaning Lie

#### The Timeline
**October 4, 2023**
- Paul asks Natalie Haigh: "Guttering - has it been cleared and cleaned?"
- Natalie Haigh confirms it has been done

**January 4, 2024**
- Defect #41: "Guttering - Needs cleaning out all of plot"

**January 17, 2024** - The Truth Revealed
Paul Taylor writes:
> "Item 41: I already know that this hasn't been done as I provided the drone photos showing that what I was told by Natalie Haigh, presumably on behalf of the build team, was not truthful. The plumbing company visited last week and confirmed that after only seeing the garage guttering that it had not been."

#### The Evidence
- Drone photos proved gutters were full of debris
- Independent plumber confirmed gutters hadn't been cleaned
- Direct contradiction of Natalie Haigh's assurance

### 3. The DPC (Damp Proof Course) Denial

#### The Issue
**NHBC Standard**: DPC should be minimum 150mm above ground level
**Reality at Plot 34**: Only 100mm (one brick and part of another)

#### The Timeline

**July 6, 2023**
- Paul reports to NHBC that air brick is "half buried on the drive"

**October 26, 2023**
- Trinity Rose Construction Assessment confirms: "the garage DPC is less than half of the NHBC's minimum required tolerance"

**December 14, 2023**
- Paul states: "The DPC at the garage dividing the two doors should be a minimum of 150mm, not one brick and a part of a brick"

**January 5, 2024**
- Paul reports: "the issue with the DPC at the garage remains unresolved. Your build manager claims that a 100mm standard is acceptable, but this is not supported by the technical requirements"

**January 25, 2024** - Crest's Response
Lynn Carrington claims:
> "A garage is not deemed habitable and is constructed of single skin brickwork and is not impervious to wind driven rain"

**The Missing Evidence**
- Crest promised documentation proving garages don't need proper DPC
- This documentation was never provided
- Pattern of making claims without backing them up

---

### 4. The Buried Air Brick - A Critical Safety Issue

#### What Happened
- Air brick was buried halfway under the driveway
- This violates NHBC standards: air bricks "should not be blocked or covered by soil or paving"
- **Paul had to identify this himself**
- Despite "15 checks", Crest's inspections missed this safety issue

#### The Significance
- Air bricks provide essential ventilation to prevent damp
- Burying them can lead to serious structural issues
- This is a fundamental building error
- Shows the "15 checks" were either not done or incompetently performed

## Pattern of Misrepresentation

### 1. Make Bold Claims
- "Checked 15 times"
- "Gutters have been cleaned"
- "Garages don't need proper DPC"

### 2. Get Caught in Lies
- 45 defects prove inadequate checking
- Drone photos prove gutters weren't cleaned
- Trinity Rose confirms DPC violations

### 3. Deflect and Deny
- Claim garages have different standards
- Promise documentation that never arrives
- Continue to deny issues exist

### 4. Never Take Accountability
- No apology for false information
- No explanation for inspection failures
- No compensation for Paul having to find issues himself

---

## The Human Cost

### What Paul and Jade Had to Do
1. **Identify safety issues themselves** (buried air brick)
2. **Hire drone photography** to prove gutters weren't cleaned
3. **Get independent assessments** (Trinity Rose, plumber)
4. **Live with 45 defects** after being told property was thoroughly checked
5. **Fight for basic standards** while being gaslit about requirements

### The Bigger Picture
If Crest will lie about:
- Gutters being cleaned (easily verifiable)
- Number of inspections (documented process)
- NHBC standards (published requirements)

**What else are they willing to misrepresent?**

## Key Evidence Quotes

**November 23, 2023** - Paul Taylor:
> "Major items like DPC work had to be done which could not have been checked"

**January 17, 2024** - Paul Taylor:
> "what I was told by Natalie Haigh, presumably on behalf of the build team, was not truthful"

**October 17, 2023** - Paul Taylor:
> "Their build manager claimed he had snagged the property 15 times"

## Violations of New Homes Quality Code

### Principle 1 - Fairness
- Multiple proven misrepresentations
- False claims about property condition
- Misleading information about inspections

### Part 3.1 - Quality of Home at Handover
- 45 defects on completion
- Safety issues not identified
- Property not ready for habitation

### Part 3.3 - Defects and Snagging
- Inadequate inspection process
- False claims about completed work
- Failure to identify critical issues

---

## Conclusion

The evidence shows a clear pattern where Crest Nicholson:
1. **Made false claims** about inspection thoroughness
2. **Lied directly** about completed work (gutters)
3. **Denied legitimate issues** without evidence (DPC)
4. **Failed to identify** critical safety problems
5. **Showed no accountability** when caught in lies

This wasn't incompetence - it was systematic misrepresentation. When a company lies about something as simple as whether gutters have been cleaned, it reveals a culture where false claims are acceptable if they avoid immediate work or responsibility.

Paul and Jade Taylor deserved honest information about their largest life purchase. Instead, they received lies, denials, and a property with 45 defects that had supposedly been checked 15 times.
