## Email Content

Good afternoon James/Nigel,

I have just received the attached response from Crest (dated 25th June 2025, from Charlie Joseph) which contains demonstrable misrepresentations of their own surveyor's findings.

Please could you pass this to the ombudsman? It shows that despite their surveyor's report being very clear as to the cause, they are still mischaracterising what the report says.

Charlie Joseph states in her letter: "Please note, the report has been forwarded to New Homes Ombudsman Service (NHOS), under claim reference NHOS-2024-000512, for their review."

While they may have sent the report to the NHOS, I doubt they will have sent the attachment just sent to me, which misrepresents the report to make it seem like this is not an issue.

**Crest claims:** "not anticipated to have any adverse effects on the long-term performance"  
**MJA actually states:** "lead to an early failure of the render" - they are being told the render will fail early but it's somehow just cosmetic

**Crest claims:** "superficial" and "natural shrinkage and movement"  
**MJA actually identifies:** "further movement joints should be cut into the east and west elevations"

**Crest claims:** Still a "goodwill gesture"  
**MJA proves:** Necessary remediation, with blockwork needing to be cut into can not be considered a goodwill gesture

Despite being proven wrong by their own commissioned surveyor, Crest continues to mischaracterise construction defects as cosmetic issues. This demonstrates exactly why I believe my complaint was valid - they will never acknowledge fault regardless of evidence.

This is what I have endured for almost 4 years now, 2 of which they will not allow me to discuss (without giving a valid reason, breaking their own confidentiality agreement).

I am begging now for the ombudsman to make their decision; my family and I cannot continue having to deal with this company. If they had just admitted fault and apologised, we would not be in the position of having to make a claim. When proven wrong and having the opportunity to apologise, they are instead doubling down. It's heartbreaking to have to spend so much money with a company that has zero respect for their customers.

Many thanks,  
Paul

## Key Points

### Direct Contradictions Highlighted:

1. **Long-term performance:**
   - Crest: "no adverse effects"
   - MJA: "early failure of the render"

2. **Nature of defects:**
   - Crest: "superficial"
   - MJA: Requires cutting movement joints into blockwork

3. **Remediation necessity:**
   - Crest: "goodwill gesture"
   - MJA: Essential structural intervention

### Important Context:
- **4 years** of issues with Crest
- **2 years** under NDA that Crest won't discuss
- Paul willing to settle for an **apology without NDA**
- Financial compensation is **secondary**
- Family suffering from prolonged dispute
