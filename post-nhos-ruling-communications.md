# Post-NHOS Ruling Communications

## Message 1: To Crest Nicholson Board of Directors

**Subject: NHOS Ruling NHOS-2024-000512 - Notice of Public Awareness Campaign**

Dear Board Members,

Well done. I didn't think it was possible to take on a CEO more incompetent or devious than Peter Truscott. I just wanted to take the time to inform you, now that the NHOS has ruled in my favour, that I am currently in the process of building an online presence specifically targeted at Crest customers, with the intent of informing them of their rights, how Crest will manipulate them, even bully them, I'm talking about Adrian Simms, and how they use the system that was built to help them, like it helped my family and I. 

I'm targeting those living in the following areas:
- Campbell Wharf, Milton Keynes
- Windsor Gate, Windsor
- Finberry, Ashford
- Henley Gate, Ipswich
- Brooklands Park, Bristol
- Nobel Park, Oxfordshire
- Newlands Place, Arborfield Green
- Cringleford Heights, Norwich
- Curbridge Meadows, Whiteley
- And all other Crest developments

I'm advertising on Facebook and other social media. I even have a website explaining in detail what I had to go through with Crest. I of course won't be mentioning the details of the contents of the NDA, but I will say that Crest broke the agreement by refusing to allow me to discuss those contents with the NHOS, even though a valid and justifiable reason was supposed to be given (none were).

Regards,
Paul Taylor

## Message 2: To Crest Nicholson Institutional Investors

**Subject: Material Governance Concerns - NHOS Ruling Against Crest Nicholson**

Dear [Investor Relations / Fund Manager],

I am writing to bring to your attention serious governance failures at Crest Nicholson that pose material risks to shareholder value.

**Background:**
The New Homes Ombudsman Service has ruled in my favor (Case: NHOS-2024-000512) after Crest Nicholson:
- Misrepresented their own structural engineer's findings to the regulator
- Dismissed structural defects as "cosmetic" for 18 months
- Proposed remediation they knew would fail

**Material Concerns:**

1. **Regulatory Deception**: Crest told NHOS that render defects would have "no adverse effects on long-term performance" when their own expert (MJA Consulting) stated it would "lead to early failure of the render."

2. **Systemic Issues**: This is not an isolated incident. I have documented evidence of similar patterns across multiple properties and years.

3. **Financial Impact**: With pre-tax profits of only Â£22.4m and warnings of potential loan covenant breaches by April 2025, the reputational damage from a coordinated consumer awareness campaign could be devastating.

4. **Governance Failure**: The board has allowed a culture where senior management misrepresents facts to regulators - a serious breach of corporate governance standards.

**Actions Being Taken:**
- Launch of CrestNicholsonReviews.co.uk documenting evidence
- Targeted digital advertising to potential buyers at all Crest developments
- Active community building through r/CrestNicholsonReviews
- Coordination with other affected buyers

**Questions for Management:**
1. Were the board aware that management was misrepresenting expert findings to NHOS?
2. What controls exist to prevent regulatory deception?
3. How many similar cases are currently suppressed by NDAs?
4. What is the total contingent liability for defect remediation if properly addressed?

Given Crest's precarious financial position (potential April 2025 covenant breach), I believe shareholders deserve transparency about these systemic governance failures and their potential impact on enterprise value.

I am happy to provide full documentation of the NHOS ruling and evidence to any investor conducting due diligence.

Regards,
Paul Taylor
