1. **February/March 2023**: Site manager promises June/July completion

## The Human Impact

### What This Looked Like
- Professional removal crew standing idle
- Belongings in limbo - can't unload properly
- Unable to enter the home they're buying
- Neighbors watching the embarrassing situation
- Children's routines disrupted
- Pets in carriers for extended period

### Financial Impact
- Removal crew charges by the hour
- Risk of having to reschedule if too late
- Already paid multiple rebooking fees
- Mortgage arrangement at risk

### Emotional Impact
- Humiliation of standing outside own home
- Stress of not knowing when/if completion would occur
- Frustration after 5-6 months of delays
- Anxiety about removal crew overtime charges

---

## This Was Preventable

### What Should Have Happened
1. Contract finalized weeks before completion
2. All legal matters resolved in advance
3. Smooth handover on the morning of completion
4. Keys available when removal van arrived

### What Actually Happened
1. Legal matters still being resolved on the day
2. No clear communication about timing
3. Buyers treated as inconvenience
4. Corporate process prioritized over human dignity

---

## Evidence of Systematic Failure

### The October 25 vs 31 Dispute
- Crest refused Paul's October 25 date (only 4 working days earlier)
- Insisted on October 31 for "end of year targets"
- Shows pattern of prioritizing corporate needs

### The December 13 Accusation
**Solicitor Hannah Rafferty**: "At this point we think they are doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires. There's no other explanation."

### The Pattern
1. Promise dates they can't meet
2. Fail to prepare documentation
3. Leave everything to last minute
4. Make buyers bear the consequences

## Conclusion

December 18, 2023 represents the culmination of Crest Nicholson's systematic failures. After a 5-6 month delay from the original promise, multiple failed completion dates, and constant communication failures, Paul and Jade Taylor were subjected to the final indignity of standing outside their own home with a removal van for over 2.5 hours while Crest scrambled to complete legal requirements that should have been resolved weeks earlier.

This was not an unavoidable situation - it was the direct result of Crest's pattern of leaving everything to the last minute, prioritizing corporate targets over customer welfare, and showing complete disregard for the human impact of their failures.

**The image is stark**: A family with their entire life in a removal van, standing outside a house they cannot enter, waiting for a company that has already delayed them by 6 months to complete basic paperwork.
