# Mortgage Expiry Leverage - November-December 2023

## Overview
This document details how Paul Taylor used the threat of mortgage expiry and the potential voiding of the 25 Abbots Road NDA as leverage against Crest Nicholson during the delayed completion of Plot 34/10 Colt View.

## Background: 25 Abbots Road
- **Previous Property**: Paul and Jade previously owned 25 Abbots Road
- **Buyback**: Crest bought the property back for £690,000
- **Profit**: Paul made £85,000 on the transaction
- **Total Cost to Crest**: £155,000 (including resale loss)
- **NDA**: Non-disclosure agreement preventing discussion of issues
- **Restriction**: Memorandum of Agreement restricts discussing with "third parties"

## The Mortgage Expiry Threat

### November 1, 2023 - Initial Threat
Paul instructed his solicitor Hannah Rafferty to convey to Crest:
> "I would be grateful if you could impress upon them that if our mortgage offer expires, they will have to do the work on 25 Abbots Road, and they lose their non disclosure agreement. It's therefore in their best interests to start communicating with you."

### The Leverage Explained
Paul was threatening that if Crest's delays caused their mortgage to expire:
1. The NDA on 25 Abbots Road would be considered void
2. Crest would have to perform remedial work on 25 Abbots Road
3. The issues with 25 Abbots Road could become public

### November 1, 2023 - Second Thoughts
Later the same day, Paul reconsidered and asked Hannah to "soften" the approach:
> "They're the type of company that would cut their head off to spite their entire body."

He added:
> "We're worried about the mortgage offer; we could have been moved in already had they done their job properly."

## Escalating Concerns

### November 2023 Pattern
- **10 emails** specifically about mortgage expiry concerns
- Solicitor repeatedly raised "concern (again) regarding the mortgage offer expiry"
- Clear pattern of increasing urgency as mortgage deadline approached

### December 13, 2023 - Suspicion of Deliberate Delay
Paul expressed his belief that Crest was acting maliciously:
> "At this point we think they are doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires. There's no other explanation."

## Financial Stakes

### Mortgage Costs at Risk
- **£999**: Mortgage broker fee (The Mortgage Workshop)
- **£1,495**: Mortgage arrangement fee
- **£6,000**: Reduction in borrowing ability due to rate increases

### Timeline Pressure
- **Original Promise**: June/July 2023 completion
- **Actual Completion**: December 18, 2023
- **Delay**: 5-6 months (exceeding typical mortgage offer validity)

## Strategic Analysis

### Why This Was Effective Leverage
1. **Financial Threat**: Crest had already spent £155k resolving 25 Abbots Road
2. **Reputational Risk**: NDA void would allow public discussion of issues
3. **Legal Complexity**: Unclear if NDA would actually be void, but threat created uncertainty
4. **Remedial Work**: Threat of having to do work they'd paid to avoid

### Crest's Position
- Caught between completing quickly and their "end of year targets"
- Risk of losing £155k investment in 25 Abbots Road silence
- Potential reputational damage if issues became public

## Outcome
Despite the threats and leverage attempts:
- Crest maintained their timeline
- Completion occurred December 18, 2023
- Mortgage apparently didn't expire (or was extended)
- NDA on 25 Abbots Road remained in place

## Significance for NHOS Complaint
This episode demonstrates:
1. **Desperation**: The mortgage expiry risk was so severe Paul resorted to threats
2. **Power Imbalance**: Buyers forced to use any leverage available
3. **Systematic Delays**: 5-6 month delay pushed mortgage to expiry
4. **Corporate Indifference**: Even threat of £155k loss didn't expedite completion
5. **Emotional Toll**: Resort to threats shows level of stress and desperation

The fact that Paul felt compelled to threaten voiding a previous NDA to get Crest to complete on time illustrates the severity of their mismanagement and the power imbalance in the relationship.
