# NHOS Complaint - Mortgage Rate Loss Section

## For inclusion in formal complaint to Crest Nicholson

### The Issue
Due to Crest Nicholson's repeated delays in completing Plot 34 Albany Wood (10 Colt View), we lost our favorable mortgage rate and were forced to accept a significantly higher rate, causing substantial financial harm.

### Timeline of Events

**February 2023**
- We were shopping for mortgages with rates available from 4.38% (5-year fixed)
- Our mortgage broker, Leanne Athill from The Mortgage Workshop, was helping us secure the best available rate

**March-May 2023**
- Crest continued to delay completion despite our repeated warnings
- Bank of England raised base rate to 4.25% (March 23, 2023)
- Mortgage rates continued climbing

**June 6, 2023**
- We explicitly warned Crest: "Our mortgage advisor has informed us that the rates have gone up, meaning our borrowing ability has dropped by approximately £6k"
- We stated: "We could not have made it any clearer to Mr Sims and Peter Truscott (CEO) that the delays are jeopardising everything"

**June 8, 2023**
- Our solicitor calculated: "the extra we are going to have to pay for the term is £7,552.20, only because of the delay from Crest"
- Despite this clear evidence of financial harm, Crest refused to adjust the purchase price or expedite completion

### Financial Impact

**Mortgage Details:**
- Mortgage amount: £490,000
- Best rate available (February 2023): 4.38%
- Rate we were forced to accept: 4.72%

**Financial Loss:**
- Extra payment per month: £94.82
- Total additional interest over 5-year fixed term: **£8,136.87**
- Less equity built after 5 years: £2,447.98

### Our Position

1. We repeatedly warned Crest that delays would impact our mortgage
2. Crest failed to act with appropriate urgency
3. We suffered quantifiable financial harm of £8,136.87
4. This was entirely preventable had Crest honored their completion timelines

### What We Seek

Financial compensation of £8,136.87 representing the additional interest charges we will pay over our 5-year fixed mortgage term, directly caused by Crest's delays.

### Supporting Evidence
- Email correspondence with mortgage broker showing rate progression
- Emails explicitly warning Crest about mortgage rate risks
- Solicitor's calculation of financial impact
- Current mortgage documents showing final rate of 4.72%
