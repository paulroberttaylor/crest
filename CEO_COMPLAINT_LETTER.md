# Formal Complaint to CEO Martyn Clark
## Systematic Customer Mistreatment - Plot 34, 10 Colt View

**To:** Martyn Clark, Chief Executive Officer  
**From:** Paul Robert Taylor  
**Date:** [To be sent post-NHOS decision]  
**Subject:** Formal Complaint - Systematic Customer Mistreatment and New Homes Quality Code Violations

---

Dear Mr. Clark,

I am writing to formally complain about the systematic mistreatment my wife Jade and I received during our purchase of Plot 34 (10 Colt View) at Albany Wood, which represents fundamental failures in Crest Nicholson's customer service, quality control, and professional standards under your leadership.

This complaint is being submitted following the conclusion of our current NHOS cases (NHOS-2024-000512 and related matters) and documents additional violations that were not covered by those specific complaints.

## Executive Summary

Our experience reveals a systematic pattern of customer mistreatment that includes:

- **£8,136.87 financial harm** from deliberate delays without compensation
- **2 hours 37 minutes standing outside our own home** on completion day
- **45 major defects** found despite claims of "15 quality checks"
- **Multiple safety violations** we had to identify ourselves
- **Proven misrepresentations** about property condition and inspections
- **2.5:1 communication ratio** - requiring multiple emails for basic responses

This is not about render issues or path access (covered by existing NHOS complaints), but about fundamental failures in how Crest treats customers making their largest life purchase.

## 1. Financial Harm Through Deliberate Delays

### The Mortgage Rate Scandal

**February 8, 2023**: We secured a 4.38% mortgage rate based on your completion promises.  
**June 6, 2023**: I warned Crest that "rates have gone up, meaning our borrowing ability has dropped by approximately £6k"  
**June 7, 2023**: Your solicitor confirmed Crest "is not willing to change the purchase price" despite clear evidence of financial harm.  
**June 8, 2023**: Our solicitor calculated the "extra we are going to have to pay for the term is £7,552.20, only because of the delay from Crest"

**Final cost: £8,136.87 additional mortgage interest over 5 years**

### The Broken Completion Promises

**Original Promise**: June/July 2023 (site manager during viewing)  
**May 18, 2023**: I questioned why solicitors said September/October when your "building team were confident it would be ready in June or July"  
**Actual Completion**: December 18, 2023  
**Total Delay**: 5-6 months from original promise

**October 10-11, 2023 Corporate Targets Over Customer Needs**:  
Your team refused October 25 (our only available date) but insisted on October 31 for "end of year targets" - a mere 4 working days difference with no reasonable explanation except corporate convenience.

**October 24, 2023**: Your solicitor Hannah Rafferty admitted "I do not believe we will be ready to complete on 31st October" - just 7 days before the scheduled date.

## 2. Completion Day Disaster - December 18, 2023

This day epitomizes Crest's approach to customer service:

**1:50 PM**: I arrive with removal van and professional crew  
**2:28 PM**: Eileen Guihen (your Sales & Marketing Director) states "unable to release keys until legal completion"  
**2:31 PM**: Only garage access granted  
**4:27 PM**: Finally "Funds released, key release instructed"

**We stood outside our own home for 2 hours 37 minutes** while:
- Professional removal crew stood idle (charged by the hour)
- Neighbors witnessed our humiliation
- Your senior director prioritized process over basic human dignity

This was the culmination of purchasing our dream home - made into a nightmare by Crest's incompetence.

## 3. The "15 Checks" Lie and Quality Control Failure

### The False Quality Promise

Your build manager claimed to have checked the property "approximately 15 times" plus a Stage 12 inspection, yet **45 major defects were found on January 4, 2024**, including:

- Water damage to dishwasher door
- Settlement cracks in multiple rooms
- Garage DPC and water leakage issues
- **Guttering full of debris** (despite October assurances it was cleaned)
- Multiple door, window, and wardrobe issues
- Grass laid on top of existing grass

### Build Manager's Admission of Incompetence

**January 5, 2024**: Your build manager admitted to me: **"you probably know more about NHBC standards than myself"**

This is your quality control representative admitting a customer knows building standards better than Crest employees.

## 4. Safety Violations We Had to Identify

### The Buried Air Brick

**July 6, 2023**: I had to report to NHBC that the air brick was "half buried on the drive" - a serious safety violation that violates basic NHBC standards about ventilation and could cause damp problems.

**Your "15 checks" missed this basic safety issue.**

### The DPC Violation and ACO Drain Requirement

**October 26, 2023**: Trinity Rose expert assessment confirmed "garage DPC is less than half of NHBC's minimum required tolerance"
- **NHBC Standard**: 150mm minimum above ground level
- **Your Build**: Only 100mm

**I had to identify the DPC issue myself**, which was so serious that Crest had to:
- **Lift the entire rear path**
- **Install an ACO drain system**
- Acknowledge the violation of basic building standards

**December 14, 2023**: I had to educate your team that DPC should be 150mm minimum, not "one brick and a part of a brick"

**January 25, 2024**: Lynn Carrington attempted to deflect by claiming garages don't need proper DPC, contradicting Trinity Rose experts and NHBC standards.

**March 12, 2024**: I demanded final response on inadequate DPC. Crest promised evidence that garages don't need proper DPC but **never provided it** because no such evidence exists.

## 5. Proven Misrepresentations

### The Gutter Cleaning Lie

**October 4, 2023**: Natalie Haigh confirmed gutters were cleaned when I asked directly  
**January 4, 2024**: Defect list shows gutters need cleaning  
**January 17, 2024**: Drone photos and plumber confirmation proved **gutters were never cleaned**

This wasn't a mistake - it was a deliberate lie to a customer asking a direct question.

### The Trinity Rose Payment Scandal

**November 30, 2023**: "Crest didn't pay for Trinity Rose to provide a report of what had and had not been completed from the original survey, which defeated the object of having it done"

Your £1,300 payment failure directly contributed to completion delays, yet you continued to blame customers for the chaos you created.

## 6. Communication Failures - The 2.5:1 Ratio

### "URGENT: 10 Colt View" Thread Analysis (December 5-13, 2023)

**36 total emails** over 9 critical days:
- **I sent**: 25 emails (69%)
- **Crest responses**: 10 emails (28%)
- **Ratio**: 2.5 customer emails required for each Crest response

This pattern repeated throughout our purchase:
- **163-day response delays** documented
- Multiple instances of having to chase for basic information
- Urgent matters requiring repeated follow-up

### Solicitor's Assessment

**December 13, 2023**: Our solicitor stated: "At this point we think they are doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires"

Your communication failures were so severe that professionals questioned whether they were deliberate sabotage.

## 7. New Homes Quality Code Violations

Your systematic failures violate multiple sections:

**Part 2.5 (Completion Dates)**: 5-6 month delay without compensation for £8,136.87 mortgage loss  
**Part 3.1 (Quality at Handover)**: 45 defects despite "15 checks" claim  
**Part 3.3 (Defects and Snagging)**: Safety violations requiring customer identification  
**Principle 1 (Fairness)**: Multiple proven misrepresentations and financial harm  
**Principle 5 (Responsiveness)**: 2.5:1 communication ratio and 163-day delays

## 8. The Human Cost

Beyond the financial harm and safety violations, your failures caused:

- **Emotional distress** from 2.5+ hours standing outside our own home
- **Financial stress** from £8,136.87 additional mortgage costs
- **Safety concerns** from living with building violations
- **Loss of trust** in the home-buying process
- **Ongoing anxiety** about undiscovered defects

We purchased our dream home and you turned it into a nightmare through systematic incompetence and indifference.

## 9. Pattern Recognition: This Is Corporate Strategy

Our experience reveals deliberate patterns:

1. **Make unrealistic promises** to secure sales
2. **Fail to provide documentation** to delay contracts
3. **Create artificial obstacles** to justify delays
4. **Misrepresent property condition** to avoid responsibility
5. **Require constant customer chasing** to exhaust complainants
6. **Force customers to become experts** to identify your failures

This isn't incompetence - it's calculated customer mistreatment designed to:
- Maximize corporate profits through corner-cutting
- Exhaust customers into accepting substandard service
- Shift responsibility from Crest to customers

## 10. Previous Experience: Pattern Confirmed

Our experience with 25 Abbots Road (covered by NDA) confirms this is systematic. Two properties, same builder, same patterns of mistreatment. This isn't bad luck - it's corporate culture.

## 11. What We Seek

1. **Written acknowledgment** that our treatment violated New Homes Quality Code
2. **Written apology** from you personally as CEO for the systematic failures
3. **Compensation** for quantified financial harm (£8,136.87 minimum)
4. **Commitment to change** - specific reforms to prevent future customer mistreatment
5. **No confidentiality requirements** - we retain the right to share our experience

**We do not seek excessive compensation - we seek accountability and change.**

## 12. Your Personal Responsibility

Mr. Clark, I contacted you directly on **June 23, 2025** with MJA report evidence of structural defects in our render. You chose to ignore that evidence and authorized misrepresentation to NHOS through Charlie Joseph.

You are now being informed of systematic purchase treatment failures under your leadership. These failures happened on your watch, under your corporate culture, by your employees.

**You are ultimately responsible for this.**

The question is whether you will continue the pattern of denial and deflection, or finally acknowledge that Crest's approach to customer service is fundamentally broken and requires immediate reform.

## 13. Next Steps

I expect a comprehensive response within 14 days addressing:
- Each violation detailed above
- Your acknowledgment of responsibility
- Concrete steps for compensation and reform

Failure to provide a satisfactory response will result in:
- Public documentation of our experience
- Escalation to relevant authorities
- Consideration of additional legal remedies

## Conclusion

Mr. Clark, our experience represents everything wrong with the modern home-building industry - a systematic prioritization of corporate profits over customer welfare, corner-cutting over quality, and deflection over accountability.

You have the opportunity to break this pattern. You can acknowledge these failures, compensate the harm caused, and implement real reforms to prevent future customer mistreatment.

Or you can continue the corporate strategy of denial, deflection, and customer exhaustion that has defined our experience with Crest Nicholson.

The choice - and the responsibility - is yours.

We await your response.

Yours sincerely,

**Paul Robert Taylor**
