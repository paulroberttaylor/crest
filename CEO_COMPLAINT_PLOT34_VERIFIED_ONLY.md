*Note: Full 45-item defect list contained in PDF attachment requires individual investigation of each item*

### 2.2 Trinity Rose Construction Assessment Violations (October 2023)

Independent MRICS surveyor Oliver Culhane identified multiple NHBC standards violations:

2.2.1 **Main House DPC Below Required Height**
Primary damp proof course installed below NHBC's required 150mm clearance. Investigation required into:
- Design specification deviation
- Approval process for non-compliance
- Inspection sign-off despite violation
- Long-term moisture implications

2.2.2 **Garage DPC Critical Failure**
Garage DPC measured at only 70mm above ground level - less than half NHBC minimum requirement. This fundamental violation requires:
- Immediate structural assessment
- Water ingress risk evaluation
- Warranty validity implications
- Systemic pattern investigation

2.2.3 **Window and Door Reveals Out of Tolerance**
Trinity Rose documented reveals not built to NHBC tolerances for straightness and plumb requiring:
- Construction methodology review
- Quality control failure analysis
- Aesthetic and functional implications
- Remediation specifications

2.2.4 **Pipework Boxing Severely Out of Square**
Measurements showing boxing out by up to 14mm requiring investigation of:
- Installation competence
- Supervision adequacy
- Pattern across property
- Professional standards compliance

2.2.5 **Roof Void Unsealed - Active Infestation**
Gaps exceeding 4mm maximum (NHBC Chapter 7.2.19) with fly infestation discovered:
- Health and safety implications
- Sealing specification failures
- Inspection oversight investigation
- Current infestation status

2.2.6 **Soil Vent Pipe Termination Failure**
Open-ended soil vent pipe in loft space not connected to ventilation system:
- Building Regulations Part H violation
- Health hazard assessment required
- Installation deviation investigation
- Correction verification needed

2.2.7 **External Ground Levels Incorrect**
Ground levels causing DPC failures requiring:
- Design versus as-built analysis
- Approval for level changes
- Impact on moisture protection
- Remediation requirements

2.2.8 **Drainage System Lacking Confirmed Overflow**
Rear door drainage system inadequacies requiring:
- Design specification review
- Flood risk assessment
- Building regulations compliance
- Remediation specification

### 2.3 Critical Safety Issue - Customer Identified (July 2023)

2.3.1 **Air Brick Buried Under Driveway**
Despite claimed multiple inspections, customer identified air brick "half buried on the drive" violating NHBC standards. Investigation required into:
- How 15 checks missed critical safety violation
- Ventilation adequacy assessment
- Correction verification
- Pattern of inspection failures

### 2.4 Structural Render Defects - MJA Consulting Report (June 2025)

Structural engineer R.Flanagan identified critical render system failures:

2.4.1 **Western Gable Elevation Crack**
Located halfway along elevation in upper render zone:
- Repaired twice, failed both times
- Pattern of inadequate remediation
- Root cause investigation required

2.4.2 **Front Elevation Vertical Crack**
Running from cast cill to ensuite and lead flashing:
- Structural movement implications
- Water ingress pathways
- Long-term degradation risks

2.4.3 **Eastern Gable Crack at Eaves**
Junction failure requiring investigation of:
- Design detail adequacy
- Installation compliance
- Movement patterns

2.4.4 **Critical Finding - Movement Joints Absent**
MJA identified complete absence of movement joints on elevations exceeding 6000mm:
- Fundamental design failure
- NHBC compliance violation
- Accelerated render degradation predicted
- Complete re-rendering required

### 2.5 Major Remediation Already Required

2.5.1 **ACO Drain Installation - Entire Path Lifted**
Due to severity of rear garage DPC violation:
- Complete path reconstruction required
- ACO drainage system installation
- Major disruption to property
- Pattern of inadequate initial construction

2.5.2 **Ongoing Water Ingress Despite Remediation**
February-March 2024 correspondence documents continuing water entry to garage despite attempted fixes:
- Remediation failure patterns
- Fundamental design issues
- Dismissal of legitimate concerns
- Ongoing property damage

### 2.6 Additional Specific DPC Violation

2.6.1 **Garage Dividing Wall DPC**
December 2023 documentation: "The DPC at the garage dividing the two doors should be a minimum of 150mm, not one brick and a part of a brick" (approximately 100mm):
- Build manager falsely claimed 100mm acceptable
- Pattern of competence issues
- Multiple DPC failures across property

## Investigation Requirements for All Defects

Each documented defect requires comprehensive investigation including:
- Original specification versus as-built conditions
- Approval documentation for any deviations
- Inspection records and sign-offs
- Competence verification of personnel involved
- Pattern analysis across development
- Current status verification
- Remediation specifications and verification
- Warranty and insurance implications
- Regulatory compliance assessment
- Long-term impact evaluation

The breadth of failures documented by multiple independent sources (customer, MRICS surveyor, structural engineer, and Crest's own staff) indicates systemic quality control failures requiring board-level investigation.
