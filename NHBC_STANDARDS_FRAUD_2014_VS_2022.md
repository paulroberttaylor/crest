# NHBC Standards Fraud - Using 2014 Standards on 2022 Build

## Critical Discovery - July 23, 2025

### NHBC's Official Confirmation
From Mark Nelson, Technical Complaints Handler, NHBC (July 23, 2025):

> "Our records confirm that your specific plot was registered on 28 September 2022, therefore making the NHBC Standards 2022 applicable to your home."

> "I can confirm that following a full file review, there is no evidence to suggest that NHBC was ever notified of any intention to build any property using incorrect versions of the NHBC Standards. Additionally, I can confirm that no permission has been given by NHBC to build using any NHBC Standards other than those applicable at the time."

## Crest's Admissions

### Helen Massey-Crow (Associate Company Solicitor) Email Trail:

**April 28, 2025:**
- Initially claimed "2015 NHBC Technical Standards" applied
- Admitted they "do not hold a copy of the 2015 Standards"

**May 13, 2025:**
- Changed story: "NHBC has advised that they did not release a new version of the standards in 2015"
- Now claimed "the relevant standards that applied to the Property in respect of the rendering at the time of construction were the 2014 NHBC standards"
- Provided link to 2014 standards

## The Fraud

1. **Plot Registered**: September 28, 2022
2. **Required Standards**: NHBC 2022
3. **Standards Used**: NHBC 2014 (8 years out of date)
4. **NHBC Permission**: NONE - "no permission has been given"

## Impact on 10 Colt View

### 2014 vs 2022 Standards - Key Differences:
- **Movement Joints**: Requirements have evolved significantly
- **DPC Heights**: Standards have been updated
- **Render Systems**: Modern standards reflect current best practices
- **Quality Control**: 2022 standards include lessons from 8 years of building failures

### Specific Violations:
1. Movement joints missing (required for walls over 6m even in 2014)
2. Garage DPC at 70mm (2014 required 150mm minimum)
3. Air brick buried under driveway
4. Multiple other defects that newer standards would have prevented

## Legal Implications

1. **Building Regulations Breach**: Built to wrong standards without permission
2. **Consumer Fraud**: Sold as NHBC 2022 compliant when built to 2014
3. **Warranty Issues**: NHBC warranty may be invalid due to non-compliance
4. **Corporate Liability**: Deliberate use of outdated standards

## Pattern Across Albany Road Development

- **66 homes** potentially affected
- All built after September 2022 registration
- All should have used 2022 standards
- Systemic fraud across entire development

## Evidence Trail

1. **Crest Admission**: Helen Massey-Crow emails confirming 2014 standards used
2. **NHBC Denial**: No permission ever given to use old standards
3. **Registration Date**: September 28, 2022 = 2022 standards mandatory
4. **Cover-up Attempt**: Initially claimed 2015 standards, then changed story

## Action Required

1. Criminal investigation for building regulation fraud
2. NHBC to review all 66 homes at Albany Road
3. Full remediation to 2022 standards
4. Compensation for buyers deceived about compliance
