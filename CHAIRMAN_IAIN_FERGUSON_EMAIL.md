# Email to Chairman Iain Ferguson

## Subject: Your Leadership, Your Culture, Your Accountability

Dear Mr. Ferguson,

You have been Chairman of Crest Nicholson since November 2019. Under your leadership, my family has endured systematic failures at two separate properties.

## The Pattern Under Your Watch

**25 Abbots Road (2021-2023)**: Two years of defects, denials, and corporate dismissiveness. Result: Forced buyback.

**10 Colt View (2023-Present)**: Identical patterns. Same denials. Same tactics. Same culture.

## The Culture You've Created

Your company's letter templates claim Crest "takes complaints seriously." The evidence proves otherwise:

- **NHOS Complaint**: Your solicitor submitted 2014 building standards for a 2023 build
- **NHBC Investigation**: Ongoing regarding those outdated standards
- **Structural Defects**: Denied for 18 months, proven by your own engineer
- **CEO Engagement**: Martyn Clark ignored evidence just as Peter Truscott did

## The Common Denominator

CEOs have changed. Regional managers have changed. The culture of denial, delay, and deception remains constant. That culture comes from the top - from you.

Under your chairmanship, Crest has become synonymous with:
- Building to obsolete standards
- Denying obvious defects
- Exhausting customers into submission
- Misrepresenting facts to regulators

## Your Legacy

You could have changed things when Peter Truscott left. You didn't.
You could have insisted on better when appointing Martyn Clark. You didn't.
You could have fixed the culture after our first buyback. You didn't.

Instead, you've presided over a company that:
- Causes documented medical harm to families
- Builds homes with structural defects
- Submits incorrect information to regulatory bodies
- Refuses reasonable requests without justification

## The Question

How many more families must suffer before you act? How many more buybacks? How many more regulatory investigations?

The rot starts at the top, Mr. Ferguson. And that's with you.

This isn't about one property or one family. It's about the systematic failure of leadership you've overseen since 2019.

## What Happens Next

My family's medical team is documenting the health impacts of your company's treatment.
Regulators are investigating your building standards.
The pattern is documented across multiple properties.

You can either:
1. Continue presiding over this culture of denial and face increasing scrutiny
2. Take genuine accountability and implement real change

The choice, like the responsibility, is yours.

Paul Taylor
