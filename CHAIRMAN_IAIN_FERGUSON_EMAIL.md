# Email to Chairman Iain Ferguson

## Subject: Your Leadership, Your Culture, Your Accountability

Dear Mr. Ferguson,

You have been Chairman of Crest Nicholson since November 2019. Under your leadership, my family has endured systematic failures at two separate properties.

## The Pattern Under Your Watch

**25 Abbots Road (2021-2023)**: Two years of defects, denials, and corporate dismissiveness. Result: Buyback of property 

**10 Colt View (2023-Present)**: Identical patterns. Same denials. Same tactics. Same culture.

## The Culture You've Created

Your company's letter templates claim Crest "takes complaints seriously." The evidence proves otherwise:

- **NHOS Complaint**: Your solicitor confirmed that Crest used 2014 building standards for a 2023 build, with 66 properties on the development
- **Either the entire development had 2014 standards applied, or our property was singled out. Which is it?
- **NHBC Investigation**: Ongoing regarding those outdated standards and missing movement joints
- **Structural Defects**: Denied for 18 months, proven by your own engineer
- **CEO Engagement**: Martyn Clark ignored evidence just as Peter Truscott did, and breached the NDA by not providing any reason, let alone a justifiable one, for refusing permission to discuss 25 Abbots Road with the NHOS 

## The Common Denominator

CEOs have changed. Regional managers have changed. The culture of denial, delay, and deception remains constant. That culture comes from the top - from you.

Under your chairmanship, Crest has become synonymous with:
- Building to obsolete standards
- Denying obvious defects
- Exhausting customers into submission
- Misrepresenting facts to regulators

## The Trap You've Created

We cannot sell our home. If we don't get the structural work done, we cannot honestly say there are no problems. If we do get the work done, we must disclose major structural repairs were required. Either way, your company's failures have trapped us financially - just as you did with 25 Abbots Road.

## Your Legacy

You could have changed things when Peter Truscott left. You didn't.
You could have insisted on better when appointing Martyn Clark. You didn't.
You could have fixed the culture after our first buyback. You didn't.

Instead, you've presided over a company that:
- Causes documented medical harm to families
- Builds homes with structural defects
- Submits incorrect information to regulatory bodies
- Refuses reasonable requests without justification


## What Happens Next

- My family's GP is documenting the health impacts of your company's treatment, and has knowledge of the first property .
- The NHBC is investigating Crest's admission of using 2014 standards for a 2023 build
- The NHOS is nearing a decision on my complaint
- I have raised a formal complaint with Martyn Clark, and if the response is what is typical from Crest, I will be raising another NHOS complaint after the 56 days.


Mr Taylor
