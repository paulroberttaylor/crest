# Buyback or Destruction - Your Choice

**Date: July 23, 2025**  
**To: Martyn Clark (CEO), Mark Foyle, Charlie Joseph**  
**Subject: NHBC Fraud Discovered - Buyback or Public Destruction**

Gentlemen,

Today's NHBC letter confirms what we suspected - you committed fraud.

## What We Now Have Confirmed

### 1. NHBC Standards Fraud (Confirmed Today)
- **NHBC Letter (July 23, 2025)**: Your property was registered September 28, 2022, making 2022 Standards mandatory
- **Your Admission**: Helen Massey-Crow confirmed in writing you used 2014 standards - 8 years out of date
- **NHBC Statement**: "no permission has been given by NHBC to build using any NHBC Standards other than those applicable"
- **Impact**: All 66 homes at Albany Road built fraudulently to wrong standards

### 2. False NHBC "Sign Off" Claims 
- **September 28, 2023**: Natalie Haigh wrote "NHBC sign off" to pressure completion
- **January 25, 2024**: Lynn Carrington claimed "The NHBC have approved our standard drawings and signed off the property"
- **NHBC Today**: "NHBC do not 'sign off' homes as defect free"
- **Conclusion**: You lied about regulatory approval to force completion and refuse remediation

### 3. Weber Manufacturer Warnings About NHOS-Mandated Work
- **"removing render especially bonded render is never a good choice, yes its very messy, very disruptive and very noisy"**
- **"the face of the outer leaf will undoubtable be destroyed"** when using mechanical tools
- **"more harm than good"** - Weber's assessment of the mandated work
- **"as a last resort"** - when render removal should be considered
- **Reality**: NHOS has ordered work that your own manufacturer says will destroy our home

### 4. Mental Health Impact - Nearly 4 Years
- **25 Abbots Road**: You completed a buyback due to mental health and wellbeing impacts
- **Pattern Repeated**: Same issues now at 10 Colt View
- **GP Letters**: Being prepared confirming continuous impact across both properties
- **Medical Recommendation**: Family should not be forced to continue living under these conditions
- **GP Advice**: Crest should buyback as before for family wellbeing

### 5. CEO Direct Knowledge
- **June 23, 2025**: I emailed you directly, Martyn, with the MJA report proving structural defects
- **Your Response**: Silence, then authorized misrepresentation to NHOS
- **Pattern**: CEO personally aware but chose to continue the deception

## What Happens Next If You Don't Act

- **NHBC Formal Investigation**: 66 homes built to wrong standards without permission
- **Widespread Discovery**: Every Albany Road owner learns their home was built fraudulently
- **Media Interest**: Pattern of defects across multiple properties, mental health impacts
- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: False claims about NHBC approvals
- **Public Documentation**: Four years of evidence becomes publicly available
- **Industry Questions**: Why 2014 standards on 2022 builds?
- **Shareholder Concerns**: Pattern of buybacks and structural defects

## The Simple Solution

**Buyback of 10 Colt View**

This makes everything disappear:
- NHOS complaint withdrawn
- No fraud investigation
- No media exposure
- No neighbor questions about destructive work
- No class action from 66 homeowners
- Complete confidentiality

## Your Alternative

Tomorrow morning:
- Website goes live with full evidence
- Media contacts activated
- NHBC formal complaint filed
- Trading Standards criminal complaint
- Every Albany Road owner contacted
- Shareholder notifications sent

## Decision Required Today

By 5pm today, email confirmation:
"Crest Nicholson agrees in principle to purchase 10 Colt View. Terms to be agreed."

After 5pm, the campaign launches. Once public, there's no going back.

## The Reality You Face

- **NHBC has confirmed**: You built 66 homes to wrong standards without permission
- **Weber has confirmed**: The mandated work will destroy the property
- **Medical evidence confirms**: Nearly 4 years of family harm requiring intervention
- **You've done this before**: 25 Abbots Road buyback set the precedent
- **NHOS mandate**: You must either destroy our home or face regulatory breach
- **The evidence**: Indisputable, documented, and ready for public consumption

A buyback makes all of this vanish - just like it did at 25 Abbots Road. Complete separation benefits everyone.

The alternative is explaining to shareholders, regulators, and buyers why you:
- Built 66 homes fraudulently
- Lied about NHBC approvals
- Must now destroy properties to comply with NHOS
- Ignored medical evidence of family harm
- Chose public scandal over private resolution

5pm today.

**Note**: This is not a negotiation. The evidence is catastrophic. Agree to the buyback principle today, or face it all publicly tomorrow.
