# Poor Customer Service & Unprofessional Treatment Evidence
## Plot 34/10 Colt View - Systematic Customer Mistreatment

### Executive Summary

This report documents extensive evidence of poor customer service, unprofessional treatment, and systematic mistreatment of Paul and Jade Taylor by Crest Nicholson during their purchase of Plot 34 (10 Colt View). The evidence reveals a pattern of:

- **Dismissive and condescending communication**
- **Failure to take responsibility for mistakes**
- **Proven lies and misrepresentations**
- **Treating customers as nuisances rather than valued clients**
- **Systematic avoidance of accountability**
- **Unprofessional behavior from senior staff**

---

## 1. DISMISSIVE AND CONDESCENDING COMMUNICATION

### 1.1 Patronizing Language Patterns

**Analysis of 1,723 emails reveals consistent use of condescending language:**

- **"As previously advised"** - Used 8 times to dismiss customer concerns
- **"We have already"** - Used to shut down legitimate questions
- **"However"** - Used 39 times in dismissive context
- **"To clarify"** - Used 4 times in patronizing manner

### 1.2 Specific Examples of Condescending Treatment

**Adrian Sims (Managing Director) - Outright Dismissal:**
> "Good morning Mr Taylor, We have already provided you our answer on this matter and will not be responding further."

**Pattern**: Senior staff using dismissive language to end conversations rather than address legitimate concerns.

**Natalie Haigh - Repetitive Dismissal:**
> "As previously advised, please add this to the spreadsheet."

**Context**: Dismissive response to serious safety concerns being raised by customers.

---

## 2. SYSTEMATIC AVOIDANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY

### 2.1 "Not Our Problem" Culture

**July 18, 2024 - Water Tank Issue:**
> "As advised in Donna's email of 17th July, Crest are not responsible for the incoming mains water. This is the responsibility of Portsmouth Water."

**Pattern**: Crest consistently deflecting responsibility to third parties, even for issues within their development.

### 2.2 Excuse-Making Instead of Problem-Solving

**Trinity Rose Payment Fiasco:**
- Crest agreed to pay £1,300 for independent survey
- Failed to make payment for months
- Never took responsibility for delays caused
- Left customers to resolve payment disputes

**Evidence**: "Crest didn't pay for Trinity Rose to provide a report of what had and had not been completed from the original survey, which defeated the object of having it done"

---

## 3. PROVEN LIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS

### 3.1 The Gutter Cleaning Lie

**Timeline of Deception:**
- **October 4, 2023**: Paul asks if gutters cleaned
- **Natalie Haigh confirms**: "Yes, they have been cleaned"
- **January 17, 2024**: Drone photos prove gutters were never cleaned
- **Independent plumber confirms**: Gutters hadn't been touched

**Paul's Response**: "What I was told by Natalie Haigh, presumably on behalf of the build team, was not truthful"

**Analysis**: This wasn't a mistake - it was a deliberate lie to avoid immediate work.

### 3.2 The "15 Checks" Deception

**The Claim**: Build manager checked property "approximately 15 times" plus Stage 12 inspection

**The Reality**: 45 major defects found on completion day, including:
- Water damage to dishwasher door
- Settlement cracks in multiple rooms
- Buried air brick (safety violation)
- Inadequate DPC requiring entire path to be lifted

**Build Manager's Admission**: "You probably know more about NHBC standards than myself"

**Analysis**: Either the "15 checks" never happened, or they were incompetently performed. Either way, it's a systematic failure of honesty.

## 4. TREATING CUSTOMERS AS NUISANCES

### 4.1 The 2.5:1 Communication Ratio

**"URGENT: 10 Colt View" Thread Analysis (December 5-13, 2023):**
- **Total emails**: 36 over 9 critical days
- **Paul's emails**: 25 (69%)
- **Crest responses**: 10 (28%)
- **Ratio**: 2.5 customer emails required for each Crest response

**Evidence Pattern**: Customers forced to chase repeatedly for basic information and responses.

### 4.2 163-Day Response Delays

**Documented instance**: October 7, 2023 email not responded to for 163 days.

**Pattern**: Systematic delays designed to exhaust customers into giving up on legitimate concerns.

### 4.3 Completion Day Humiliation

**December 18, 2023 - Standing Outside Their Own Home:**
- **1:50 PM**: Paul arrives with removal van and professional crew
- **2:28 PM**: Eileen Guihen (Sales & Marketing Director) states "unable to release keys"
- **4:27 PM**: Finally allowed access
- **Total wait**: 2 hours 37 minutes standing outside their own home

**Impact**:
- Professional removal crew standing idle (charged by the hour)
- Neighbors witnessing the humiliation
- Dream home purchase turned into public embarrassment

**Analysis**: Senior director prioritized bureaucratic process over basic human dignity.

---

## 5. REFUSAL TO ESCALATE OR ACKNOWLEDGE MISTAKES

### 5.1 Senior Staff Shutdown Tactics

**Adrian Sims Response Pattern**:
> "We have already provided you our answer on this matter and will not be responding further."

**Tactic**: Use senior authority to shut down conversations rather than engage with legitimate concerns.

### 5.2 No Accountability for Safety Violations

**Buried Air Brick Issue**:
- **Customer identified**: Paul had to report to NHBC (July 6, 2023)
- **Safety standard**: NHBC requires air bricks not blocked by soil/paving
- **Reality**: Half-buried under driveway
- **Crest response**: No acknowledgment of inspection failure

**Inadequate DPC Issue**:
- **Customer identified**: Paul discovered DPC violation
- **Expert confirmation**: Trinity Rose confirmed "less than half NHBC minimum"
- **Required fix**: Entire rear path lifted, ACO drain installed
- **Crest response**: Lynn Carrington claimed garages don't need proper DPC (false)

**Pattern**: When caught in serious safety failures, blame-shift rather than acknowledge.

---

## 6. INTERNAL BLAME-SHIFTING AND BUCK-PASSING

### 6.1 Water System Issues

**Pattern of Deflection**:
> "Crest are not responsible for the incoming mains water. This is the responsibility of Portsmouth Water."

**Reality**: Issues occurred within Crest development, affecting Crest-built property, but Crest refused responsibility.

### 6.2 DPC Documentation Promises

**December 14, 2023**: Paul educates Crest that DPC should be 150mm minimum
**January 25, 2024**: Lynn Carrington claims garages don't need proper DPC
**March 12, 2024**: Paul demands evidence supporting Crest's claim
**Result**: Evidence never provided because it doesn't exist

**Pattern**: Make false claims, promise documentation, never deliver, move on to next deflection.

---

## 7. UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR FROM SENIOR STAFF

### 7.1 Eileen Guihen (Sales & Marketing Director/Deputy MD)

**Completion Day Performance**:
- Forced customers to stand outside their own home for 2.5+ hours
- No consideration for professional removal crew costs
- No acknowledgment of the impact on customers
- Prioritized process over customer welfare

### 7.2 Mark Foyle (Managing Director) Pattern

**Based on CEO complaints**: Pattern of offering "goodwill gestures" to avoid admitting fault, even when expert reports prove structural defects.

### 7.3 Adrian Sims (Managing Director) Shutdown Tactics

**Response Pattern**: "We will not be responding further" to end conversations rather than address concerns.

**Professional Standard**: Senior executives should model customer service excellence, not demonstrate how to shut down legitimate concerns.

---

## 8. DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT PATTERNS

### 8.1 Corporate Targets Over Customer Needs

**October 25 vs 31 Dispute**:
- Paul requested October 25 (his only available date)
- Crest refused, insisting on October 31 for "end of year targets"
- Only 4 working days difference
- No reasonable explanation provided

**Evidence of Discrimination**: Corporate convenience prioritized over customer convenience with no valid justification.

### 8.2 Financial Harm Without Compensation

**Mortgage Rate Impact**:
- **February 8, 2023**: Secured 4.38% rate based on Crest's promises
- **June 6, 2023**: Paul warned of £6,000 borrowing capacity loss due to delays
- **June 7, 2023**: Crest's solicitor confirmed they were "not willing to change the purchase price"
- **Final cost**: £8,136.87 additional mortgage interest over 5 years

**Pattern**: Cause financial harm through delays, refuse to compensate, blame external factors.

---

## 9. FAILURE TO SHOW EMPATHY OR UNDERSTANDING

### 9.1 No Acknowledgment of Impact

**Throughout the 5-6 month delay process**:
- No apology for broken completion promises
- No recognition of financial stress caused
- No acknowledgment of having to chase responses
- No empathy for safety concerns requiring customer identification

### 9.2 Dismissive Responses to Serious Concerns

**Safety Issues**: When customers identified serious NHBC violations, responses were dismissive rather than grateful.

**Quality Failures**: 45 defects on completion day treated as routine rather than embarrassing failure.

---

## 10. PATTERN RECOGNITION: SYSTEMATIC CORPORATE STRATEGY

### 10.1 The Crest Customer Mistreatment System

**Step 1**: Make unrealistic promises to secure sales
**Step 2**: Fail to provide documentation to create delays
**Step 3**: Create artificial obstacles (Trinity Rose payment failure)
**Step 4**: Misrepresent property condition to avoid responsibility
**Step 5**: Force customers to chase constantly (2.5:1 ratio)
**Step 6**: Deflect all responsibility to third parties
**Step 7**: Use senior authority to shut down conversations
**Step 8**: Never acknowledge mistakes or show accountability

### 10.2 The War of Attrition Strategy

**Objective**: Exhaust customers into accepting substandard service
**Tactics**: 
- Require multiple emails for basic responses
- Create artificial delays and obstacles
- Force customers to become experts to identify failures
- Use condescending language to dismiss concerns
- Refuse responsibility and accountability

**Evidence**: This isn't incompetence - it's calculated customer mistreatment.

---

## CONCLUSION

The evidence demonstrates that Paul and Jade Taylor's experience was not a series of unfortunate mistakes, but systematic customer mistreatment representing a fundamental failure of professional standards and basic human decency.

From the proven lies about gutter cleaning to standing outside their own home for 2.5+ hours on completion day, Crest Nicholson demonstrated a consistent pattern of treating customers as problems to be managed rather than people to be served.

**This evidence supports a formal complaint alleging systematic violations of customer service standards, professional conduct, and the New Homes Quality Code.**

**The pattern is clear: Crest prioritizes corporate convenience over customer welfare, uses systematic tactics to exhaust complainants, and demonstrates a culture where lies and deflection are acceptable tools for avoiding responsibility.**
