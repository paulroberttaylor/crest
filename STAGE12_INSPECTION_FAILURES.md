# What Stage 12 Inspection Missed at Plot 34/10 Colt View
## Critical Defects Found After October 6, 2023 "Passed" Inspection

### Executive Summary
Stage 12 inspection "passed" Plot 34 on October 6, 2023, clearing it for completion. However, multiple subsequent inspections revealed serious NHBC standards violations and safety issues that should have failed the property. This document compares what Stage 12 should have found versus what was discovered afterward.

## Critical Defects Stage 12 Missed

### A. SAFETY VIOLATIONS

#### 1. Damp Proof Course (DPC) Failures
**Trinity Rose Found (October 25, 2023):**
- Main house DPC below required 150mm clearance
- Garage DPC only 70mm above ground (less than half NHBC minimum)
- Email quote: "the garage DPC is less than half of the NHBC's minimum required tolerance"

**Stage 12 Should Have Found:**
- DPC violations are fundamental building regulation breaches
- Easily visible and measurable
- Critical for preventing damp and structural damage

#### 2. Air Brick Burial
**Paul Taylor Found (July 6, 2023):**
- Air brick "half buried on the drive"
- NHBC Standard: Air bricks must not be blocked by soil or paving
- Paul had to identify this himself despite "15 checks"

**Stage 12 Should Have Found:**
- This was visible BEFORE Stage 12 inspection
- Basic ventilation requirement check
- Serious damp risk if not corrected

### B. STRUCTURAL DEFECTS

#### 3. Roof Space Violations
**Trinity Rose Found:**
- Fly infestation indicating unsealed roof void
- Gaps larger than 4mm (exceeding permitted standard)
- Open soil vent pipe unfinished in loft

**Stage 12 Should Have Found:**
- Roof void inspection is standard Stage 12 check
- Open vent pipe is obvious safety/building reg failure
- Gaps visible to any inspector

#### 4. Window and Door Reveals
**Trinity Rose Found:**
- Window reveals not built to NHBC tolerances for straightness/plumb
- Door reveals not built to NHBC tolerances for straightness/plumb
- Pipework boxing out of square by up to 14mm

**Stage 12 Should Have Found:**
- Basic measurement checks
- Visible defects affecting finish quality
- NHBC tolerance checks are standard

### C. COMPLETION-CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 5. Ground Levels and Drainage
**Trinity Rose Found:**
- Incorrect ground levels causing DPC failures
- Drainage system lacks confirmed overflow for rear doors
- Required ACO drain installation (November 28-29, 2023)

**Stage 12 Should Have Found:**
- Ground levels are fundamental to DPC compliance
- Drainage requirements are basic building standards
- These failures required major remedial work

## Evidence of Stage 12 Failure

### Build Manager's Knowledge Gap
**December 14, 2023 Email:**
- Build manager claimed 100mm DPC was acceptable
- Paul corrected him: "The DPC at the garage dividing the two doors should be a minimum of 150mm, not one brick and a part of a brick"
- **January 5, 2024**: Build manager admitted knowing less than Paul about NHBC standards

### Pattern of Missed Defects
1. **Before Stage 12**: Air brick already buried (July 2023)
2. **During Stage 12**: All Trinity Rose findings were present
3. **After Stage 12**: 45 defects found on completion
4. **Long-term**: Render cracks due to missing movement joints

### Trinity Rose Professional Opinion
From their report: Multiple NHBC standards violations that would have been visible during any competent inspection.

## Comparison Table: Stage 12 vs Reality

| Defect Category | Stage 12 Found | Trinity Rose Found | Lynn Found | Total Missed |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| DPC Violations | 0 | 2 major | Multiple | 2+ |
| Roof Issues | 0 | 3 (vent, gaps, flies) | Unknown | 3+ |
| NHBC Tolerances | 0 | 3 (windows/doors) | Multiple | 3+ |
| Safety Issues | 0 | 1 (air brick) | Multiple | 1+ |
| Snagging Items | Unknown | Not assessed | 45 | 45 |
| **TOTAL** | **0** | **9+** | **45+** | **54+** |

## Impact of Stage 12 Failures

### 1. Immediate Consequences
- Property not fit for completion
- Major remedial work required (ACO drain)
- Safety risks to occupants

### 2. Long-term Consequences
- Render failure due to missing movement joints
- Potential damp issues from DPC violations
- Early failure of building elements

### 3. Financial Impact
- Cost of independent surveys (Trinity Rose Â£1,300)
- Remedial work costs
- Future repair costs from missed defects

## Conclusion

Stage 12 inspection comprehensively failed to identify:
- **2 major safety violations** (DPC and air brick)
- **3 roof space violations** (including open vent pipe)
- **3 NHBC tolerance failures** (windows/doors)
- **45 snagging items** found at completion
- **Structural defects** requiring movement joints

The build manager's claim of "15 checks" is contradicted by the evidence. Either:
1. The checks were not performed properly, or
2. The inspection was inadequate for the stage of construction

Trinity Rose's professional assessment found "multiple NHBC standards violations" just 19 days after Stage 12 "passed" the property. These were not new defects - they existed during Stage 12 inspection.

**Key Finding**: Stage 12 inspection missed at least 54 defects, including critical safety violations that should have prevented the property from proceeding to completion.
