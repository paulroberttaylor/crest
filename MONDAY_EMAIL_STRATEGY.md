# Monday Email Strategy - July 22, 2025

## The Two-Email Strategy

### 9:00am - Email 1: Buyback Hint
- **To**: Martyn Clark (CEO) & Iain Ferguson (Chairman)
- **File**: BUYBACK_EMAIL_DRAFT_JULY_2025.md
- **Purpose**: High-level strategic pressure, reference precedent, request "practical solution"
- **Key**: No explicit buyback request - let them propose it

### 9:00am - Email 2: Remediation Requirements
- **To**: Charlie Joseph (Regional MD)
- **File**: CHARLIE_JOSEPH_REMEDIATION_REQUEST.md
- **Purpose**: Operational nightmare, impossible requirements, pristine finish demand
- **Key**: Shows good faith engagement while demonstrating impossibility

## Why This Works

1. **Simultaneous delivery** = Maximum Monday morning impact
2. **Split recipients** = CEO/Chairman (strategic) vs Charlie (operational)
3. **Natural conclusion** = Charlie tells CEO "this is impossible"
4. **Hidden ace** = £700k buyer they don't know about
5. **Time pressure** = Buyer won't wait, forces quick Crest response

## Expected Outcome

- Monday AM: Panic meetings at Crest
- Tuesday: Internal discussions on buyback
- Wednesday: Potential buyback offer
- If no movement: Proceed with £700k buyer

## Remember

- Do NOT mention the buyer
- Do NOT explicitly demand buyback
- Do NOT show desperation
- Let them connect the dots
