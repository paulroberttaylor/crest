The initial report was done and those issues have been raised with Crest. That appears to meet that requirement.\r\n\r\nSnagging usually happens after completion, and you could obtain a snagging inspection if you wish. That is quite normal with new builds but is outside the scope of the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all of the above is that this effectively puts you in a position of usual purchaser of a new build property but with the benefit of having had a surveyor go in at an earlier stage. If you wish to involve Trinity Rose further, that would be at your cost, unless Crest offer to pay for it (which seems unlikely).\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSerhan Handani LL.B (Hons), LL.M\r\nPartner\r\n[untitled-2-45]\r\n\r\nADVANCE NOTICE OF LEAVE \u2013 28th November \u2013 11th December 2023\r\n\r\nUnit 10 Vicarage Farm Business Park, Winchester Road, Fair Oak, SO50 7HD\r\n141 Elm Grove, Southsea, Hampshire, PO5 1HR\r\nT: 02382 514300 E: sh@bramsdonandchilds.com<mailto:sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nWebsite: www.bramsdonandchilds.com<http://www.bramsdonandchilds.com/>\r\n[facebook]Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/bramsdonandchilds> [twitter]  @Bramsdon_Childs<https://twitter.com/Bramsdon_Childs> [linkedin]  LinkedIn\r\n[cid:image005.jpg@01DA1D52.FA9FA060]     [Home]\r\n\r\nAuthorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (under no 47593)\r\nThe information contained in this message may be confidential and is intended for the addressee only.

I received confirmation this morning that they have had no\r\ncontact from Crest Nicholson.\r\n\r\nI have already forwarded their fee structure to you and received\r\nconfirmation via email last week, which I subsequently conveyed to Trinity\r\nRose.

They require a confirmation by\r\nthe close of business today; otherwise, they will not be available for the\r\nsurvey on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nI also have the following specific questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - Your internal surveyor has yet to complete their assessment of plot\r\n   34; how can we proceed under the assumption that only minor issues will be\r\n   present?\r\n   - Has the issue with the kitchen boxing been resolved?\r\n   - We are still waiting for your response concerning the garage personnel\r\n   doors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Paragraph 19 a of the signed reservation agreement, Crest must\r\nconfirm the property as \"build complete\" before we can arrange our own\r\nsurvey. It's therefore premature to schedule a survey with only one day\r\navailable for resolving stage 12 issues.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this email as soon as possible and include our solicitors\r\nin your reply.

As explained originally via\r\nthe solicitors, the original quote did not include packing as we believed\r\nwe would have had more time.  This is now no longer the case.\r\n\r\nThis quote is what it would have been normally, so is as per the agreement,\r\nand is for your records only.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Taylor\r\n",
      "Subject: Management company and open area\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\nTo: Mark Foyle <Mark.Foyle@crestnicholson.com>\nDate: Thu, 9 Jan 2025 10:47:19 +0000\nGood morning Mr. Foyle,\r\n\r\nI am writing to raise several concerns regarding the management of the\r\ndevelopment and unresolved matters:\r\nManagement Company Charges\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the management company appointed by Crest\r\nhas doubled their charges for 2025. Additionally, they are charging\r\nresidents \u00a35,000 per year to empty what are essentially public bins. This\r\namount is extortionate, even if residents were responsible for them.\r\nHowever, these bins would ordinarily be emptied by the council. As the open\r\narea is still not yet suitable for council adoption, the council has\r\nunderstandably not taken responsibility for them. This responsibility\r\nshould rest with Crest.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if you could ensure these bins are emptied by a Crest\r\nrepresentative or an appointed company and that SPAM is instructed to\r\nremove this fee from the estate charges.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this as a formal complaint dated today, and ensure it is\r\naddressed accordingly as per NHOS guidelines and timelines.\r\nOpen Area Landscaping\r\n\r\nRegarding the open area, you assured me that the gap providing access to\r\nthe farmer\u2019s road would be filled with plants by the end of 2024. This was\r\nconfirmed in your email dated Monday, 14th October 2024, at 18:26, in\r\nresponse to my email of Wednesday, 4th September 2024, at 11:30. However,\r\n88 days have now passed since your confirmation, and 128 days since my\r\ninitial email complaining about this, with no action taken.\r\n\r\nAs this matter has exceeded the 56-day threshold, I am prepared to escalate\r\nthis to the NHOS. Before doing so, please could you provide an update on\r\nwhen this will be completed. I assume the farmer will be liaised with to\r\nhave the railings removed which prevented further access to Crest, after\r\nthe previous attempt to block it was removed by Crests' groundworkers.\r\nPath Issue\r\n\r\nI was informed by the NHOS that you would be contacting me regarding the\r\npath linking both developments, which you have stated Crest wi",

We could not have\r\nmade it any clearer to Mr Sims and Peter Truscott (CEO) that the delays are\r\njeopardising everything, and said this multiple times.  Please could you\r\nadvise? We realistically need them to change the purchasing price to\r\nreflect this, and be aware that this could change again at any time.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning Natalie,\r\n\r\nThank you for requesting a retraction over the weekend of the email sent\r\nafter our meeting on Albany Road on Friday. I'm grateful that you said that\r\nyou could understand why we would be disappointed, and that is why you\r\nworded it in that way. The offer for a meal was a kind gesture, but not\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the email was still sent, I would be grateful if you could confirm\r\nfor us, to all adressees, that the content of it could have been worded in\r\na way which did not paint my husband in a negative light, however well\r\nintentioned it was.\r\n\r\nI believe that since you and Steve have not been made fully aware of the\r\nsituation, it is not possible for you to understand the frustration we\r\ncontinue to have with the way we are being treated by Crest. Mr Sims stated\r\nin his email of 1st June that there needs to not be multiple lines of\r\ncommunication, however unless everyone is aware of all facts, this can not\r\nhappen.  Going forwards, it is essential that Crest communicates correctly\r\nwithin the organisation.\r\n\r\nI will answer each of the points:\r\n\r\n-- They advised we have wasted their time as they believed the property\r\nwould be pre plastered, they wanted to check this today, as this is the\r\nmain issue in their current property.\r\n\r\nOur time is not being used productively.

      "Subject: Re: Plot 34 Crest\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\nTo: Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\nDate: Wed, 7 Jun 2023 09:42:58 +0100\nGood morning Serhan,\r\n\r\nWhile it's great news that they are agreeing to do the exchange after the\r\nproperty has been checked, the fact that we have reduced borrowing and\r\nincreased monthly payments because of Mr Sims will mean that they are\r\nmaking the entire transaction untenable, to the point where it may be\r\nnecessary to go ahead and do the work, losing their non-disclosure\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nThey need to be reasonable, since their actions, or lack thereof, is what\r\nhas put us in this position.  We can not take out a mortgage based on the\r\ncurrent borrowing and interest rates unless they are willing to cover the\r\ndifference, which in the bigger picture is pennies to them.\r\n\r\nIt needs to be made clear that we told them this would happen if they\r\ndelayed the process, and is a direct result of Mr Sims not doing what he\r\npromised.  The longer this takes going back and forth it could become\r\nworse, and we need to reserve tomorrow to get our mortgage advisor to lock\r\nin a rate.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your work on this.  It comes down to whether they want to\r\ndo the work or not. There is nothing else to purchase after they made us\r\nlose the property we found and we can't control what the mortgage lenders\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 7 Jun 2023 at 09:08, Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Good morning both,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Please see the response below from Crest\u2019s solicitors:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Exchange*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *If this is important to your clients, my client is content for contracts\r\n> for the sale of Plot 34 to be exchanged after the Taylor Rose survey with\r\n> completion 14 days after exchange. *\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *My client will not, however, agree to three separate surveys but will\r\n> agree, as previously confirmed, to one jointly instructed survey once the\r\n> property is build complete.*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Price*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *My client is not willing to change the purchase price that they had\r\n> agreed with your client, subject to contract, for the new property.*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>",

We spoke to our mortgage\r\nadvisor again yesterday, and it looks like the interest rates are only\r\ngoing to keep going up.  Crest has put us in this situation, and unless\r\nthey compromise (they offered us approximately \u00a320k less for 25 Abbots Road\r\nthan the agreed estate agents valuations average) they are making it\r\nimpossible to continue.\r\n\r\nWe have done literally everything we have been told to do by Crest, even\r\nwhen we keep being treated in the manner we explained in your office.\r\n\r\nAs you are on leave next week, they really need to decide what their\r\npriorities are.  By the time you are back it could be that we are\r\ncompletely priced out of the purchase, and therefore buyback.\r\n\r\nMany thanks again,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 7 Jun 2023 at 09:46, Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> I shall ask them to reconsider now.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Kind regards,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Serhan Handani LL.B (Hons), LL.M*\r\n>\r\n> *Partner*\r\n>\r\n> [image: untitled-2-45]\r\n>\r\n> Unit 10 Vicarage Farm Busines Park, Winchester Road, Fair Oak, SO50 7HD\r\n>\r\n> 141 Elm Grove, Southsea, Hampshire, PO5 1HR\r\n>\r\n> T: 02382 514300 E: sh@bramsdonandchilds.com\r\n>\r\n> Website: www.bramsdonandchilds.com\r\n>\r\n> [image: facebook]Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/bramsdonandchilds> [image:\r\n> twitter] *@*Bramsdon_Childs <https://twitter.com/Bramsdon_Childs> [image:\r\n> linkedin] LinkedIn\r\n>\r\n>      [image: Home]\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (under no\r\n> 47593)\r\n>\r\n> The information contained in this message may be confidential and is\r\n> intended for the addressee only.

We're obviously not in the\r\nposition of being able to pay for litigation, we just want to move in and\r\nforget they exist, but they're making it as difficult as possible.\r\n\r\nI did reiterate your concerns to Natalie Haigh that you have still not been\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHannah,\r\n\r\nI think the most important issue now is addressing the completion date.  It\r\nsounds from Serhan's email that while the 25th October is only 4 working\r\ndays away from the end of the month, and because they can decide not to\r\nsell to us, we don't have any say in when completion would be? They're\r\nbeing difficult just because they can be.\r\n\r\nThe problem that we now have is that the house was supposed to be in a\r\nstate where Trinity Rose could go in, but even Ollie from Trinity Rose told\r\nthem it isn't ready. The issue I told them about at the start of summer\r\nstill won't meet NHBC standards, and this has been signed off by their\r\nprofessional snagger, and building manager.\r\n\r\nI suspect at this point that they won't even be ready by the end of the\r\nmonth anyway, given that Trinity Rose has to be booked in again to perform\r\nthe official first survey once they have installed the carpets, and he\r\nalready found lots of items to be addressed within 15 minutes of being in\r\nthe property. Once those have been rectified, he then needs to go in again\r\nto verify that they did what they were supposed to do.\r\n\r\nNatalie Haigh is going to be emailing you regarding the rest of the\r\nprocess, and I am going to chase the mortgage company again this morning.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nOn Thu, 12 Oct 2023, 8:55 am Serhan Handani, <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Good morning Paul,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> I apologise for my delay.

Despite my requests since late November, this critical\r\ndocumentation has not been provided.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of our contract, Crest has an obligation to obtain and\r\npresent this certification. The absence of this certificate from Trinity\r\nRose, a stipulation drafted by Crest, is a significant concern. It is not\r\nreasonable to shift responsibility to us for this contractual requirement\r\nas Natalie Haigh did.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial for us to have the assurance that all work has been inspected\r\nand meets the agreed standards, particularly given the past issues with 25\r\nAbbots Road. I understand that challenges can arise, but it is essential\r\nfor Crest to uphold its contractual obligations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that Crest provides the complete certification from\r\nTrinity Rose, itemising all checks performed and their outcome, as soon as\r\npossible. If this issue is not resolved in a timely manner, I will have to\r\ncontact the New Homes Ombudsman in the first instance and then consider\r\nseeking legal advice.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMr Taylor\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nDate: Wed, 17 Jan 2024, 5:37\u202fpm\r\nSubject: Re:\r\nTo: Customer Service SO <customerserviceSO@crestnicholson.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nGood afternoon Ms Guihen,\r\n\r\nAs requested, I am addressing my email to the customer services email\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nI have attached  a document showing Crest's plot site levels next to\r\nTrinity Rose's detailed ",

I have reviewed the revised version. I shall address your points first.\r\n\r\nWith respect to 2.2.5 - I am unsure what you mean by full valuation. This covers the fee your mortgage lender will charge you for valuation of the property. It is not a valuation that you would undertake but one by your mortgage lender to agree the lending. I have no concerns with the wording here.\r\n\r\nClause 7.1 - I do not believe your suggested wording is necessary. I cannot see that your suggestion would be to your advantage as it would be better to have their commitment to meet the costs as set out in clause 2, irrespective of what property you end up purchasing.\r\n\r\nClause 8 - I have no concerns with their wording here. It would be wholly unusual for confidentiality to expire, that would defy the point of the clause. You are not bound to this agreement if Crest commits a material breach of the agreement, it would not be usual to include a clause to that effect, but you can request.\r\n\r\nThe confidentiality clause will not take effect if the buyback does not, for the reasons set out above.\r\n\r\nI agree the clause only protects Crest, but that is the purpose of the clause and is their consideration in offering this settlement. They would be unwilling to settle this dispute without the confidentiality and have made that clear.\r\n\r\nAs you should have no reason to need to disclose this agreement, save if you need to litigate to enforce the agreement (which you are not prevented from doing), I would advise accepting the wording.\r\n\r\nThe remaining matters appear to be terms you have yet to agree with Crest. I cannot offer you legal advice on what the terms of the settlement should be but if you wish to include the garage doors, you should negotiate to include this. They are, of course, not obligated to include them.\r\n\r\nAny incurred costs are your liability initially, not Crest. Technically you must settle all your own costs and be reimbursed by Crest. In reality, they",
