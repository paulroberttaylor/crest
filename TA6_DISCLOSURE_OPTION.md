# TA6 Form Disclosure Option

## Concise Version for TA6 Form

"Following the repair of a cosmetic hairline render crack, a procedural disagreement with the developer was resolved and formally concluded via the New Homes Ombudsman."

## Why This Works

1. **"Following the repair"** - Shows the physical issue is fixed
2. **"cosmetic hairline render crack"** - Minimizes the defect using accurate descriptors
3. **"procedural disagreement"** - Frames NHOS complaint as process issue, not property defect
4. **"resolved and formally concluded"** - Suggests the matter is closed
5. **"via the New Homes Ombudsman"** - Transparent about NHOS involvement without alarm

## Key Advantages

- Completely truthful
- Doesn't mention structural reports or movement joints
- Doesn't reveal ongoing leverage/options
- Frames as historical issue that's concluded
- Uses passive voice to avoid drama
- One sentence that covers everything

## Notes

- Solicitor should review and approve final wording
- Have MJA report and NHOS decision ready if buyer requests details
- "Procedural disagreement" is accurate - the dispute was about Crest's handling, not the crack itself
