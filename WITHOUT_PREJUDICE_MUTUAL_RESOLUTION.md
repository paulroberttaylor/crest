# WITHOUT PREJUDICE - Mutual Resolution Proposal
**Date: January 23, 2025**
**To: Mark Foyle, Charlie Joseph, Martyn Clark**
**From: Paul Taylor**
**Subject: WITHOUT PREJUDICE - Proposal for Mutual Resolution**

## WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND SUBJECT TO CONTRACT

Dear Mark, Charlie and Martyn,

I write on a WITHOUT PREJUDICE basis to explore whether we can find a mutually beneficial resolution to our ongoing matters regarding 10 Colt View.

### Current Situation

As you know, NHOS case 2024-000512 has resulted in a draft decision requiring substantial remedial works to the property. However, Weber's technical guidance indicates that the mandated render removal would "undoubtedly destroy" the wall faces - creating an impossible situation for all parties.

I have now:
- Received an offer on 10 Colt View
- Had an offer accepted on another property
- Must disclose the dispute history on the TA6 form

### The Mutual Challenge

For Crest:
- NHOS-mandated works that the manufacturer advises against
- Potential disruption to neighboring properties
- Ongoing reputational considerations
- Resource allocation for complex remediation
- My formal complaint of July 8, 2024 regarding purchase treatment (Â£8,136.87 claim)
- Potential second NHOS complaint if the formal complaint is not resolved

For my family:
- Living through destructive works with young children
- Uncertainty about the final outcome
- The need to disclose disputes to our buyer
- The desire to move forward after 4 years

### Proposed Resolution

I propose we explore a clean break that allows both parties to move forward:

1. **Crest purchases 10 Colt View** at a fair market value
   - This avoids the destructive remediation works
   - Allows proper planning for any future works
   - Removes my family from a difficult situation
   - Provides certainty for all parties

2. **Terms to be agreed:**
   - Purchase price based on current market value
   - Reasonable timeframe aligned with our onward purchase
   - Full and final settlement of all matters including the formal complaint
   - Appropriate confidentiality provisions

3. **Benefits for both parties:**
   - Avoids Weber-contradicted remediation
   - No risk of failed works leading to further disputes
   - Clean resolution without ongoing obligations
   - Preserves neighboring property values
   - Allows my family to move forward

### Next Steps

If you are willing to explore this option, I suggest:
- An initial without prejudice discussion
- Agreement on valuation methodology
- Timeline that works for both parties
- Professional handling through lawyers

This proposal is made entirely WITHOUT PREJUDICE and in the spirit of finding a pragmatic solution that works for everyone. 

Given my need to progress the TA6 form for my buyer, I would appreciate an initial response by January 27, 2025, indicating whether you would be willing to explore this approach.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Taylor
