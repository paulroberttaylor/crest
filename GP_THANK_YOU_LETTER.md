# Letter to GP - Thank You

Dear Dr Wade-West,

Thank you for seeing me last Friday during what was a very difficult time for me. Your understanding and immediate support were exactly what I needed, and I'm grateful for your compassionate response to my crisis.

The medication you prescribed is helping, and I'm taking steps to address the underlying situation that has led to this point. As discussed, this relates to an ongoing four-year housing dispute that has significantly impacted my family's wellbeing.

I am working to resolve the situation and remove my family from these harmful circumstances. Part of this involves a request to Vodafone for removal of a small credit default that occurred during the peak of this crisis. Their decision could significantly impact our ability to secure mortgage flexibility and finally escape this situation.

As mentioned during our appointment, I may need a letter from you confirming the timeline and impact of these housing issues on my mental health. I've attached a brief outline of what would be helpful for Vodafone to understand.

Thank you again for your time and support. It means more than you know.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Taylor
