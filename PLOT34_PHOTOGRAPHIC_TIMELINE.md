# Plot 34 Construction Photographic Timeline

## Evidence of Inexcusable Delays

### February 9, 2023
- Foundations complete
- Brickwork underway
- Property already at advanced construction stage

### March 14, 2023
- Virtually complete externally
- All walls up to roof height
- Windows installed
- Property weathertight

### March 30, 2023
- Fully roofed
- All windows installed
- Essentially weathertight
- Ready for internal works

### June 9, 2023
- **FULLY RENDERED**
- All external finishes complete
- Property appears move-in ready from exterior

### December 18, 2023
- Actual completion date
- **6 MONTHS** after property was fully rendered
- **10 MONTHS** after it was virtually complete externally

## Key Points

1. Render is typically one of the last external finishes applied
2. A fully rendered property in June should complete within weeks, not 6 months
3. Site manager's June/July 2023 completion indication was entirely reasonable based on construction progress
4. No legitimate construction reason for 6-month delay after full render completion
5. Photographic evidence proves the delay was purely administrative/commercial, not construction-related

## Impact

This timeline demonstrates that Crest Nicholson held a completed property for 6 months, causing:
- Loss of favorable mortgage rate (4.38% vs 4.72%)
- 4 months living among packed boxes (August-December 2023)
- Additional mortgage costs of Â£8,136.87
- Unnecessary stress and disruption to family life
