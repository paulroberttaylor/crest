# Trinity Rose Survey Violations - Plot 34/10 Colt View

## Property Inspection Report Summary - 10 Colt View, Bishops Waltham

### Executive Summary
This is a comprehensive construction assessment for a new-build property completed by Crest Nicholson. The report, which the homeowner insisted upon, revealed significant failures by the developer to meet mandatory NHBC Standards. The findings demonstrate that without this independent survey, numerous structural and finishing defects would have been missed and passed on to the homeowner.

Crucially, Crest Nicholson did not commission the surveyor to conduct a follow-up inspection to verify the completion of remedial works. This lack of a final 'de-snag' report means there is no independent proof that the identified issues were ever corrected, undermining the resolution process.

## Critical Context: The "15 Checks" Claim

Before Trinity Rose's inspection, Crest Nicholson's build manager claimed to have:
- Checked the property "approximately 15 times"
- Conducted a Stage 12 inspection (final quality check)

Despite these claims, Trinity Rose found multiple NHBC violations and safety hazards that should have been obvious to any competent inspector.

## Key Findings and Developer Failures

The independent survey identified multiple areas where the developer's work was not compliant with NHBC Standards.

### 1. Damp Proof Course (DPC) Non-Compliance ⚠️

**Main House**: While a secondary DPC was added, the primary DPC was installed below the required 150mm clearance from the ground, a fundamental building error.

**Garage**: The DPC was installed at only 70mm above ground level—less than half the minimum required height. This is a clear breach of NHBC standards (Section 10.1.5) and leaves the structure vulnerable to damp.

### 2. Widespread & Substandard Internal Finishes ⚠️

The report identified numerous window and door reveals that were not built to the required NHBC tolerances for straightness and plumb. These are not minor cosmetic flaws but significant defects in workmanship.

Specialist boxing to hide pipework was found to be grossly out of square (by up to 14mm), indicating poor quality control.

### 3. Unsafe or Incomplete Installations in Roof Space ⚠️

An infestation of flies indicated that the roof void was not properly sealed against vermin, with gaps larger than the 4mm permitted standard.

A key soil vent pipe was left unfinished and open inside the loft, requiring connection to prevent sewer gases and debris from entering the system.

### 4. Incorrect External Ground Levels & Drainage ⚠️

Ground levels around the property were not correctly set out, directly causing the DPC failures.

The drainage system for the rear doors lacked a confirmed overflow, creating a flooding risk. The developer was required to provide clarification that was never confirmed in a follow-up.

## Professional Opinion & Critical Context

The surveyor, Oliver Culhane (MRICS), identified these issues as requiring mandatory intervention by the developer. However, the true value of this report is that it exposes a level of workmanship that falls short of the standards promised to a buyer.

The fact that these fundamental issues—ranging from DPC height to incomplete plumbing and widespread finishing defects—existed at the point of handover is a serious concern. It strongly suggests that had the homeowner not commissioned this private survey, Crest Nicholson would have handed over a property with significant, non-compliant defects.

The developer's subsequent failure to fund a verification report leaves the homeowner in a difficult position, with a list of identified faults but no professional confirmation of their repair. This highlights a critical flaw in the home-buying process, where the onus falls on the purchaser to police the quality of the developer's work.

## Timeline and Key Facts

**October 25, 2023**: Trinity Rose Construction Assessment Report delivered to Paul Taylor

**October 26, 2023**: Report confirms "the garage DPC is less than half of the NHBC's minimum required tolerance"

**October 27, 2023**: Report includes "Schedule of Distortions" appendix documenting widespread defects

**Survey Commissioned**: Paul Taylor forced Crest Nicholson to pay for the initial survey

**Follow-up Refused**: Crest Nicholson refused to pay for verification that remedial works were completed

## The Unanswered Questions

Due to Crest Nicholson's refusal to fund a follow-up inspection:
- Was the garage DPC raised to the required 150mm?
- Was the open soil vent pipe properly connected?
- Were the roof void gaps sealed to prevent vermin?
- Were the drainage overflow concerns addressed?
- Were the out-of-tolerance finishes corrected?

**We simply don't know** - and that's exactly how Crest Nicholson wants it.

## Violations of New Homes Quality Code

### Principle 2 - Safety
- DPC violations leaving property vulnerable to damp
- Open soil vent pipe creating sewer gas risk
- Unsealed roof void allowing vermin access

### Principle 3 - Quality
- Widespread finishing defects beyond NHBC tolerances
- Fundamental construction errors (DPC height)
- Incomplete plumbing installations

### Part 3.3 - Defects and Snagging
- Refused to complete the snagging process with verification
- Left homeowner without proof of remediation
- Abandoned quality control midway through

## Conclusion

The Trinity Rose survey exposed that Crest Nicholson's claimed "15 checks" and Stage 12 inspection were either:
1. Never actually performed
2. Performed incompetently
3. Performed with willful blindness to defects

By refusing to fund verification of repairs, Crest Nicholson has left the Taylor family living in a property with potentially unresolved structural defects, safety hazards, and quality issues. This is not just poor service - it's a fundamental breach of the trust homebuyers place in developers.
