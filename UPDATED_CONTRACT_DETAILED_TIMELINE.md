# The Updated Contract Fiasco - Detailed Timeline

## Overview
This timeline specifically tracks the "updated contract" issue that plagued the Plot 34/10 Colt View purchase from May 2023 through December 2023. The contract was a critical document needed for completion, yet Crest failed to provide it for over 7 months.

## May 2023 - First Signs of Trouble

### May 18, 2023 10:56 AM
**From**: Paul Taylor  
**To**: Adrian Sims  
**First Red Flag**: Paul questions why completion has moved from June/July to September/October
**Context**: This suggests contract/documentation issues were already emerging

---

## June-September 2023 - Silent Period
**Note**: No specific mentions of contract updates during reservation and initial purchase phases
**Assumption**: Standard reservation documents were used, but full contract not yet prepared

---

## October 2023 - The Contract Crisis Emerges

### October 13, 2023
**From**: Serhan Handani (Solicitor)  
**Subject**: "FW: Mr and Mrs Taylor - 25 Abbots Road/34 Albany Wood - subject to contract"  
**Critical Description**: Contract described as **"vastly different from standard"**
**Implication**: This wasn't a simple purchase contract

### October 24, 2023 9:47 AM - THE CRITICAL EMAIL
**From**: Hannah Rafferty (Buyer's Solicitor)  
**To**: Paul Taylor, Serhan Handani, Jade Taylor  
**Subject**: "RE: URGENT"

## November 2023 - A Month of Waiting

### November 1-26, 2023
**Status**: Multiple emails about mortgage expiry concerns
**Contract Status**: Still not received
**Pattern**: Using mortgage expiry threats to try to get action

### November 27, 2023 11:33 AM - Still Waiting
**From**: Hannah Rafferty  
**Subject**: "Purchase - Plot 34 Albany Wood"  
**Critical Quote**: **"Once we have the amended contract and final documentation, how did you want to proceed?"**
**Significance**: 
- Nearly a month after October 31 failure
- Still waiting for amended contract
- Solicitor asking how to proceed once documents arrive (implying they haven't)

## December 2023 - Last Minute Scramble

### December 5, 2023
**Status**: Pushing for December 6 exchange
**Contract Status**: Still resolving issues
**Other Issues**: "consent for proposed works" also outstanding

### December 8, 2023 9:10 AM

**Quote**: "Our solicitor is waiting for answers to the final questions"
**Implication**: Still missing information with 10 days to deadline

### December 11-12, 2023

**Issue**: Contract watermarks and other technical issues being resolved last minute

### December 13, 2023 12:57 PM - The Accusation
**From**: Hannah Rafferty  
**Bombshell Quote**: **"At this point we think they are doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires. There's no other explanation."**

## Summary of Contract Issues

### Timeline Summary
- **May 2023**: First indication of issues (completion date confusion)
- **October 13, 2023**: Contract identified as "vastly different from standard"
- **October 24, 2023**: Contract still not provided (7 days before completion)
- **November 27, 2023**: Still waiting for amended contract
- **December 2023**: Last-minute resolution
- **Total Duration**: 7+ months to provide proper contract

### Key Problems
1. **Non-Standard Contract**: Described as "vastly different from standard"
2. **Missing Updates**: Updated version not provided when needed
3. **Amendments Delayed**: Required amendments not made timely
4. **Watermark Issues**: Technical problems even in final stages
5. **Enquiry Responses**: Full replies to enquiries not provided

### Pattern of Behavior
1. Promise completion date without having contract ready
2. Fail to provide contract when requested
3. Leave everything to last minute
4. Risk buyer's mortgage expiry
5. Require constant chasing from buyer's solicitor

### Impact
- October 31 completion failed primarily due to missing contract
- November entirely wasted waiting for documents
- December completion nearly failed
- Solicitor accused Crest of deliberate delays
- Significant stress and mortgage expiry risk

---

**Key Takeaway**: The updated contract was first needed in May 2023 but wasn't properly provided until December 2023 - a 7-month delay that nearly caused the purchase to fail and the mortgage to expire.
