# Formal Complaint - Plot 34/10 Colt View Purchase and Quality Failures

**To:** Martyn Clark, Chief Executive Officer, Crest Nicholson  
**CC:** Mark Foyle, Group Managing Director; Charlie Joseph, Regional Managing Director  
**From:** Paul Robert Taylor  
**Date:** 9 July 2025  
**Subject:** Formal Complaint - Purchase and Construction Issues at Plot 34/10 Colt View

Dear Mr. Clark,

I am writing to make a formal complaint regarding the purchase and construction of Plot 34 (10 Colt View) at Albany Wood, Bishops Waltham. This complaint is separate from NHOS case NHOS-2024-000512 regarding render defects and missing path, and separate from the NHBC claim regarding usage of 2014 standards and render work, being drafted for submission.

In accordance with the New Homes Ombudsman Service requirements:
- You must acknowledge this complaint within 5 calendar days
- You must provide a 'path to resolution' within 10 calendar days
- If not resolved within 56 calendar days, you must issue an 'eight-week letter'
- After 56 calendar days from this complaint date, I am entitled to escalate to NHOS

## Executive Summary

This complaint represents nearly four years of systematic failures across two properties. Plot 34 alone has resulted in £8,136.87 financial loss, family mental health impacts requiring medical documentation, and 50+ defects missed during your claimed 15 inspections. The pattern includes: 6-month delays with 3 months of zero progress, breach of agreements (both Reservation and NDA), false information, and completion day being so poorly handled that I had to call your Sales Director personally to obtain keys despite your solicitors confirming payment was complete. Despite Peter Truscott's retirement, Crest's culture remains unchanged. I require a CEO-signed apology, full compensation, and independent verification - with no confidentiality agreement to hide behind this time.

## Summary of Issues

This complaint concerns:
1. Six-month delay to completion causing financial losses
2. Multiple construction defects despite claimed inspections
3. False assurances regarding completed work
4. Failure to verify remediation of identified defects

## 1. Completion Delays and Financial Impact

### Timeline of Delays
- **February/March 2023**: Site manager indicated June/July 2023 completion
- **March-June 2023**: No construction progress for 3 months (documented below)
- **May 18, 2023**: Solicitor informed completion delayed to September/October 2023
- **October 24, 2023**: Solicitor confirmed property "not ready" for October 31 completion
- **December 18, 2023**: Actual completion date

This represents a delay of approximately 6 months from the original indication.

### Three Months of Zero Progress
Your own Senior Sales Manager, Natalie Haigh, documented in her June 2, 2023 email: "They visited plot 34 and were extremely unhappy the plot has not progressed since their last visit in March." She further noted that we "believe we have held the plot back on purpose due to the surrounding properties being a lot further progressed."

I subsequently confirmed in my October 7, 2023 email that we were "shown the house with no progress made since the previous visit, approximately six weeks earlier." The lack of urgency with Plot 34 directly led to the situation where completion was impossible by your October deadline.

### Impact on Living Conditions
Based on the promised September/October completion date, we boxed up half of our house at the end of August 2023. We were then forced to live among packed boxes from August through to the actual completion on December 18, 2023 - approximately 4 months of compromised living conditions.

### Financial Losses
Due to these delays, I was forced to accept a mortgage rate of 4.72%, compared to the 4.38% we had in principle before interest rates increased. We explicitly warned Crest that their delays were jeopardizing our rate and affordability - they were not interested.

On December 18, 2023, having given ample notice of our arrival time, we were left standing outside our new home with a removal van for 2 hours and 37 minutes, eventually gaining entry at 12:37pm. Eileen Guihen, your Sales & Marketing Director, was personally involved in this completion day failure.

**Calculation:**
- Rate difference: 0.34%
- Mortgage amount: £484,000
- Monthly payment increase: £94.82
- Over 5-year fixed term: £5,689.20
- Total additional interest over mortgage term: £8,136.87

## 2. Failed Quality Control Despite Multiple Inspections

### Claimed Inspections vs Reality
Your build manager informed Trinity Rose that the property had been checked "approximately 15 times" plus Stage 12 inspection. Natalie Haigh confirmed on October 9, 2023 that "Stage 12 was completed on Friday 6th October with no further works to be completed."

Yet just 19 days later, Trinity Rose found multiple NHBC violations that Stage 12 completely missed:

### Trinity Rose Findings (October 25-27, 2023)
Despite these claimed inspections, Trinity Rose Construction Assessment identified multiple issues. Notably, even on this already-delayed inspection date - months after the property should have been ready - carpets had still not been installed. Installing carpets after an inspection defeats the purpose of verifying the property is ready for handover.

Trinity Rose found:

1. **Garage DPC**: Less than half the required height above ground level (NHBC requirement: 150mm minimum)
2. **Drive levels**: Not as specified
3. **Garden levels**: Not as per plan (separate settlement reached September 2024)
4. **Soil vent pipe**: Open-ended in loft space
5. **Roof void**: Unsealed with gaps allowing vermin access

### Issues Stage 12 Failed to Identify
The October 6 Stage 12 inspection declared "no further works to be completed" yet missed:

**Trinity Rose findings (October 25, 2023)**:
- All issues listed above including critical NHBC violations

**Customer-identified issues**:
- **July 6, 2023**: I found air brick half-buried under driveway - a critical ventilation issue your inspections missed
- **January 4, 2024**: Lynn Carrington documented 45 defects during snagging

Your own build manager later admitted that I "probably know more about NHBC standards than myself" - a shocking admission from someone responsible for quality control.

Stage 12 missed over 50 defects including critical safety violations, demonstrating complete failure of your quality control process.

### Incompetence Causing Further Delays
The failure of your Stage 12 inspection directly caused additional delays:
- **October 6**: Stage 12 declares "no further works"
- **October 25**: Trinity Rose finds garage DPC "less than half of NHBC's minimum required tolerance"
- **November 9, 2023**: Natalie Haigh claims will be "endeavouring to resolve" garage DPC by November 17
- **January 2024**: Still arguing front garage DPC doesn't need to meet NHBC standards
- **December 18**: Finally complete - 2.5 months after "passed" Stage 12

Had Stage 12 been competent, these issues would have been identified and fixed in early October, allowing completion by October 31 as planned. Instead, your inspection failures added another 6 weeks of delays, compounding the financial harm and stress to our family.

The fundamental question remains: How did your build manager's "15 inspections" and Stage 12 inspection miss 50+ defects that an independent surveyor and homeowner easily found? Even after Trinity Rose identified the garage DPC as violating NHBC standards in October, your November 9 response was merely that you would be "endeavouring to resolve" it - weak language for a fundamental building regulation failure that should never have passed any of your claimed inspections.

### False Assurances
- **October 4, 2023**: I asked Natalie Haigh if guttering had been cleared of construction debris
- **October 4, 2023**: Natalie Haigh confirmed: "Yes, this has been done"
- **January 4, 2024**: Defect #41: Gutters full of building debris risking drainage system blockage
- **Evidence**: Drone photography and independent plumber confirmed gutters contained construction waste

## 3. Trinity Rose Payment and Verification Failure

Despite Paragraph 19 of the Reservation Agreement stating that Crest would instruct Trinity Rose, you failed to honor this legal obligation, leaving us to arrange it ourselves. This breach of the Reservation Agreement caused additional delays.

Crest Nicholson agreed to pay for the Trinity Rose assessment but subsequently:
- Failed to pay promptly, causing delays
- Refused to fund a follow-up inspection to verify remediation

**Result**: To this date, I have no verification that the serious defects identified by Trinity Rose have been properly addressed, including:
- Whether garage DPC was raised to required 150mm
- Whether soil vent pipe was properly connected
- Whether roof void was sealed against vermin

## 4. Additional Issues

### Ongoing Impact of Render Defects
While the render issue is subject to NHOS case NHOS-2024-000512, it continues to impact our daily life. Since autumn 2024, we have been unable to undertake any major garden improvements as we have been repeatedly told the render work is "just about to happen." This has left us in limbo for over 8 months, unable to properly enjoy or improve our outdoor space.

### Snagging Defects
Lynn Carrington documented 45 defects during January 2024 snagging, demonstrating systematic quality control failures.

### Water Pressure Issues - Dismissed then Proven
The property suffered from a banging water cylinder and repeatedly leaking dishwasher. Crest dismissively claimed our washing machine was the problem. However, when the water board attended (at Crest's request), they confirmed water pressure was at 8 bars entering the property - requiring Crest to install a pressure reducing valve. After I refused to accept Crest's dismissive response and persisted, a plumber installed a valve reducing pressure to 3 bars. Result: the banging ceased and, once the damaged door and dishwasher were replaced, no further leaks occurred. This demonstrates another instance where critical issues were only resolved because I refused to accept inadequate responses.

### Communication Failures
Analysis of correspondence shows I was required to send multiple emails to receive responses, with some delays exceeding reasonable timeframes.

## 5. Impact on Family Wellbeing and Mental Health

As with our previous property experience with Crest Nicholson, dealing with these ongoing issues is significantly affecting the mental wellbeing of our entire family. We are arranging for medical documentation to be prepared for all three family members, which will be submitted to NHOS upon the anticipated unsatisfactory conclusion of this formal complaint.

## 6. Pattern of Systematic Failures

This complaint represents nearly four years of systematic failures across two properties: two years at 25 Abbots Road culminating in a forced buyback, and now 18+ months at 10 Colt View with the same dismissive patterns. I have lost count of the hours stolen from family time spent writing emails, researching issues, and correcting Crest's mistakes.

This pattern of forcing customers to waste time and energy correcting Crest and fighting for basic accountability is not the behavior expected of a '5-star' builder. Crest's corporate culture hasn't changed one bit following Peter Truscott's retirement. Furthermore, Crest breached the confidentiality agreement regarding 25 Abbots Road by failing to provide a valid reason for refusing consent to discuss the agreement, as required under its terms.

When dealing with Crest's failures at 25 Abbots Road, we had no NHOS support yet still achieved a buyback due to the severity of the issues. We understand that property has since been marketed at £620k, representing a substantial revenue impact for Crest. With 10 Colt View, we do have NHOS support, and our complaint is nearing decision. Should the NHOS rule in our favor and require a written apology, there will be no confidentiality agreement this time for Crest to hide behind.

## Requirements for Resolution

I require the following within the 56-day period:

### 1. Comprehensive Written Response
A detailed response addressing:
- How 15 inspections plus Stage 12 missed critical defects
- Why false information was provided about gutter cleaning
- Explanation for 6-month completion delay
- Why verification of Trinity Rose remediation was refused

I require documentation of all 15 inspections claimed by your build manager, including dates, inspector names, and inspection reports, to understand how 50+ defects were missed.

Given that Stage 12 inspection - which we were advised was Crest's final quality assurance - declared 'no further works required' despite being conducted before carpets were installed, yet missed 50+ defects including critical NHBC violations found just 19 days later, I require evidence of the inspector's qualifications, training records, and the inspection checklist used.

### 2. Official Apology
A formal written apology, signed by yourself as CEO, acknowledging:
- Failure to deliver the property as promised
- Multiple inspection failures
- Provision of false information
- Failure to verify remediation

### 3. Financial Compensation
Payment of £8,136.87 representing additional mortgage costs incurred due to Crest Nicholson's delays.

### 4. Verification
Arrangement for independent verification, by a surveyor of my choosing and at Crest Nicholson's expense, that all defects identified by Trinity Rose have been properly remediated to the required NHBC standards.

## Next Steps

I trust this matter can be resolved without escalation to the New Homes Ombudsman Service. However, if this complaint is not handled in line with the NHOS timeframe, or if the response is not satisfactory, I will raise another complaint with the NHOS.

To be clear, I am not interested in:
- Non-apologies like "we're sorry you feel that way" - these are documented facts, not feelings
- Assurances that you "followed procedures" - your procedures failed to identify 50+ defects
- "Goodwill gestures" - I strongly object to NHBC standards required work being characterised as goodwill

This is not about feelings or perceptions. This is about measurable failures: 6 months of delays, 50+ missed defects, £8,136.87 in quantifiable financial harm, and a completion day so poorly handled that I had to personally call your Sales Director to obtain keys despite payment being confirmed by both solicitors.

As you were personally made aware on June 23, 2025, when I sent you the MJA report proving structural defects, these are not minor issues but systematic failures requiring executive accountability.

Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint within 5 calendar days and provide a substantive response within 20 working days as per your complaints procedure.

Yours sincerely,
Mr Taylor
