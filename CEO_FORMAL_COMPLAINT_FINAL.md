# Formal Complaint - Plot 34/10 Colt View Purchase and Quality Failures

**To:** Martyn Clark, Chief Executive Officer, Crest Nicholson  
**CC:** Mark Foyle, Group Managing Director; Charlie Joseph, Regional Managing Director  
**From:** Paul Robert Taylor  
**Date:** 9 July 2025  
**Subject:** Formal Complaint - Purchase and Construction Issues at Plot 34/10 Colt View

Dear Mr. Clark,

I am writing to make a formal complaint regarding the purchase and construction of Plot 34 (10 Colt View) at Albany Wood, Bishops Waltham. This complaint is separate from NHOS case NHOS-2024-000512 regarding render defects and missing path, and separate from the NHBC claim regarding usage of 2014 standards and render work, being drafted for submission.

In accordance with the New Homes Ombudsman Service requirements:
- You must acknowledge this complaint within 5 calendar days
- You must provide a 'path to resolution' within 10 calendar days
- If not resolved within 56 calendar days, you must issue an 'eight-week letter'
- After 56 calendar days from this complaint date, I am entitled to escalate to NHOS

## Summary of Issues

This complaint concerns:
1. Six-month delay to completion causing financial losses
2. Multiple construction defects despite claimed inspections
3. False assurances regarding completed work
4. Failure to verify remediation of identified defects

## 1. Completion Delays and Financial Impact

### Timeline of Delays
- **February/March 2023**: Site manager indicated June/July 2023 completion
- **May 18, 2023**: Solicitor informed completion delayed to September/October 2023
- **October 24, 2023**: Solicitor confirmed property "not ready" for October 31 completion
- **December 18, 2023**: Actual completion date

This represents a delay of approximately 6 months from the original indication.

### Impact on Living Conditions
Based on the promised September/October completion date, we boxed up half of our house at the end of August 2023. We were then forced to live among packed boxes from August through to the actual completion on December 18, 2023 - approximately 4 months of compromised living conditions.

### Financial Losses
Due to these delays, I was forced to accept a mortgage rate of 4.72%, compared to the 4.38% we had in principle before interest rates increased. We explicitly warned Crest that their delays were jeopardizing our rate and affordability - they were not interested.

**Calculation:**
- Rate difference: 0.34%
- Mortgage amount: £484,000
- Monthly payment increase: £94.82
- Over 5-year fixed term: £5,689.20
- Total additional interest over mortgage term: £8,136.87

## 2. Failed Quality Control Despite Multiple Inspections

### Claimed Inspections
Your build manager informed Trinity Rose that the property had been checked "approximately 15 times" plus Stage 12 inspection.

### Trinity Rose Findings (October 25-27, 2023)
Despite these claimed inspections, Trinity Rose Construction Assessment identified multiple issues. Notably, even on this already-delayed inspection date - months after the property should have been ready - carpets had still not been installed. Installing carpets after an inspection defeats the purpose of verifying the property is ready for handover.

Trinity Rose found:

1. **Garage DPC**: Less than half the required height above ground level (NHBC requirement: 150mm minimum)
2. **Drive levels**: Not as specified
3. **Garden levels**: Not as per plan (separate settlement reached September 2024)
4. **Soil vent pipe**: Open-ended in loft space
5. **Roof void**: Unsealed with gaps allowing vermin access

### Customer-Identified Issues
I personally identified and reported:
- **July 6, 2023**: Air brick half-buried under driveway - a critical ventilation issue your inspections missed

### False Assurances
- **October 4, 2023**: I asked Natalie Haigh if guttering had been cleared and cleaned
- **October 4, 2023**: Natalie Haigh confirmed: "Yes, this has been done"
- **January 4, 2024**: Defect list item #41: "Guttering - Needs cleaning out all of plot"
- **Evidence**: Drone photography and independent plumber confirmed gutters had not been cleaned

## 3. Trinity Rose Payment and Verification Failure

Crest Nicholson agreed to pay for the Trinity Rose assessment but subsequently:
- Failed to pay promptly, causing delays
- Refused to fund a follow-up inspection to verify remediation

**Result**: To this date, I have no verification that the serious defects identified by Trinity Rose have been properly addressed, including:
- Whether garage DPC was raised to required 150mm
- Whether soil vent pipe was properly connected
- Whether roof void was sealed against vermin

## 4. Additional Issues

### Snagging Defects
Lynn Carrington documented 45 defects during January 2024 snagging, demonstrating systematic quality control failures.

### Water Pressure Issues - Dismissed then Proven
The property suffered from a banging water cylinder and repeatedly leaking dishwasher. Crest dismissively claimed our washing machine was the problem. However, when the water board attended (at Crest's request), they confirmed water pressure was at 8 bars entering the property - requiring Crest to install a pressure reducing valve. After I refused to accept Crest's dismissive response and persisted, a plumber installed a valve reducing pressure to 3 bars. Result: the banging ceased and, once the damaged door and dishwasher were replaced, no further leaks occurred. This demonstrates another instance where critical issues were only resolved because I refused to accept inadequate responses.

### Communication Failures
Analysis of correspondence shows I was required to send multiple emails to receive responses, with some delays exceeding reasonable timeframes.

## Requirements for Resolution

I require the following within the 56-day period:

### 1. Comprehensive Written Response
A detailed response addressing:
- How 15 inspections plus Stage 12 missed critical defects
- Why false information was provided about gutter cleaning
- Explanation for 6-month completion delay
- Why verification of Trinity Rose remediation was refused

### 2. Official Apology
A formal written apology acknowledging:
- Failure to deliver the property as promised
- Multiple inspection failures
- Provision of false information
- Failure to verify remediation

### 3. Financial Compensation
Payment of £8,136.87 representing additional mortgage costs incurred due to Crest Nicholson's delays.

### 4. Verification
Arrangement for independent verification that all Trinity Rose findings have been properly remediated, at Crest Nicholson's expense.

## Next Steps

I trust this matter can be resolved without escalation to the New Homes Ombudsman Service. However, if this complaint is not handled in line with the NHOS timeframe, or if the response is not satisfactory, I will raise another complaint with the NHOS.

Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint within 5 calendar days and provide a substantive response within 20 working days as per your complaints procedure.

Yours sincerely,
Mr Taylor
