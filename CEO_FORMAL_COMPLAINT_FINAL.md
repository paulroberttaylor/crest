# Formal Complaint - Plot 34/10 Colt View Purchase and Quality Failures

**To:** Martyn Clark, Chief Executive Officer, Crest Nicholson  
**CC:** Mark Foyle, Group Managing Director; Charlie Joseph, Regional Managing Director  
**From:** Paul Robert Taylor  
**Date:** 9 July 2025  
**Subject:** Formal Complaint - Purchase and Construction Issues at Plot 34/10 Colt View

Dear Mr. Clark,

I am writing to make a formal complaint regarding the purchase and construction of Plot 34 (10 Colt View) at Albany Wood, Bishops Waltham. This complaint is separate from NHOS case NHOS-2024-000512 regarding render defects and missing path, and separate from the NHBC investigation regarding usage of 2014 standards and render work.

In accordance with the New Homes Ombudsman Service requirements:
- You must acknowledge this complaint within 5 calendar days
- You must provide a 'path to resolution' within 10 calendar days
- If not resolved within 56 calendar days, you must issue an 'eight-week letter'
- After 56 calendar days from this complaint date, I am entitled to escalate to NHOS

## Executive Summary

This complaint represents nearly four years of systematic failures across two properties. Plot 34 alone has resulted in £8,136.87 financial loss, family mental health impacts requiring medical documentation, and 50+ defects missed during your claimed 15 inspections. The pattern includes: 6-month delays with 3 months of zero progress, breach of agreements (both Reservation and NDA), false information, and completion day being so poorly handled that I had to call your Sales Director personally to obtain keys despite your solicitors confirming payment was complete. Despite Peter Truscott's retirement, Crest's culture remains unchanged. I require a CEO-signed apology, full compensation, and independent verification.

## Summary of Issues

This complaint concerns:
1. Six-month delay to completion causing financial losses
2. Multiple construction defects despite claimed inspections
3. False assurances regarding completed work
4. Failure to verify remediation of identified defects

## 1. Completion Delays and Financial Impact

### Timeline of Delays
- **February/March 2023**: Site manager indicated June/July 2023 completion
- **March-June 2023**: No construction progress for 3 months (documented below)
- **May 18, 2023**: Solicitor informed completion delayed to September/October 2023
- **October 24, 2023**: Solicitor confirmed property "not ready" for October 31 completion
- **December 18, 2023**: Actual completion date

This represents a delay of approximately 6 months from the original indication.

### Three Months of Zero Progress
Your own Senior Sales Manager, Natalie Haigh, documented in her June 2, 2023 email: "They visited plot 34 and were extremely unhappy the plot has not progressed since their last visit in March."

The lack of urgency with Plot 34 directly led to the situation where completion was impossible by your October deadline.

### Contract Delays
Crest sent the reservation agreement to our solicitor on June 12, 2023. For an October 31 completion, the contract should have been ready by early October. Instead, Crest's failure to provide the necessary contract documentation caused significant delays:

- **October 9, 2023**: Natalie Haigh stated "We see no reason why we cannot exchange and complete for the 31st October"
- **October 13, 2023**: The non-standard nature of the contract linked to the 25 Abbots Road transaction created complexity
- **October 24, 2023**: Just 7 days before the planned completion date, our solicitor explicitly requested: "We need the updated contract and full replies to the enquiries" and warned "I do not believe we will be ready to complete on 31st October."
- **November 27, 2023**: Nearly 3 months after contract issuance, our solicitor confirmed the key items still missing: "We still need the amended contract, warranty and consent for the proposed works." The amended contract remained the primary obstacle preventing exchange.
- **December 13, 2023**: Exchange finally occurred - just 5 days before completion.

The contract delays began much earlier than October. On July 17, 2023, Danielle Green promised an amended contract "the following week." By August 17, I had to chase: "To our concern, this has not happened. Moreover, our solicitors have made multiple unsuccessful attempts to communicate with Crest." After multiple chasers on August 30 and September 1, contracts were finally issued on August 31 - 45 days after being promised "next week." Even then, it took another 104 days until exchange on December 13, 2023. In total, what should have taken weeks took 149 days - over 5 months from promise to exchange.

Furthermore, when I specifically asked on September 1, 2023 for "a month of completion, which is specified by the New Homes Ombudsman," Crest violated NHOS Code section 2.7 by refusing to provide anything more specific than "September or October." The Code clearly states that once the roof is completed and building weatherproof, developers must "give the month when the New Home is likely to be ready." Even this vague estimate proved false - completion didn't occur until December 18, 2023, over two months after the latest promised date.

More seriously, on October 9, 2023, Natalie Haigh confirmed "The property is now build complete." According to NHOS Code section 2.7, when a property is decorated and main services connected, developers must provide the week of completion. Yet on October 9 - over two months before actual completion - we still had no specific date, let alone a week. This represents another clear violation of NHOS requirements.

This pattern of withholding critical documentation while insisting on specific dates, then failing to meet even those dates, caused additional months of delay and directly contributed to our increased mortgage costs.

The delays continued right up to exchange. On December 12-13, 2023, I had to send multiple increasingly urgent emails just to achieve exchange. Despite all parties being ready, last-minute issues arose over already-agreed wording.

### Impact on Living Conditions
Based on the promised September/October completion date, we boxed up half of our house at the end of August 2023. We then had to live among packed boxes from August through to the actual completion on December 18, 2023 - approximately 4 months of compromised living conditions.

### Financial Losses
Due to these delays, I had to accept a mortgage rate of 4.72%, compared to the 4.38% we had in principle before interest rates increased. We explicitly warned Crest that their delays were jeopardizing our rate and affordability - they were not interested.


**Calculation:**
- Rate difference: 0.34%
- Mortgage amount: £484,000
- Monthly payment increase: £94.82
- Over 5-year fixed term: £5,689.20
- Total additional interest over mortgage term: £8,136.87

## 2. Failed Quality Control Despite Multiple Inspections

### Claimed Inspections vs Reality
Your build manager informed Trinity Rose that the property had been checked "approximately 15 times" plus Stage 12 inspection. Natalie Haigh confirmed on October 9, 2023 that "Stage 12 was completed on Friday 6th October with no further works to be completed." She explicitly stated: "The stage 12 was completed on Friday 6th October, with no major items requiring remediation."

Yet just 19 days later, Trinity Rose found multiple NHBC violations that Stage 12 completely missed:

### Trinity Rose Findings (October 25-27, 2023)
Despite these claimed inspections, Trinity Rose Construction Assessment identified multiple issues. Notably, even on this already-delayed inspection date - months after the property should have been ready - carpets had still not been installed. Installing carpets after an inspection defeats the purpose of verifying the property is ready for handover.

Trinity Rose found:

1. **Garage DPC**: Less than half the required height above ground level (NHBC requirement: 150mm minimum)
2. **Drive levels**: Not as specified
3. **Garden levels**: Not as per plan (separate settlement reached September 2024)
4. **Soil vent pipe**: Open-ended in loft space
5. **Roof void**: Unsealed with gaps allowing vermin access

### Issues Stage 12 Failed to Identify
The October 6 Stage 12 inspection declared "no further works to be completed" yet missed:

**Trinity Rose findings (October 25, 2023)**:
- All issues listed above including critical NHBC violations

**Customer-identified issues**:
- **July 6, 2023**: I found air brick half-buried under driveway - a critical ventilation issue your inspections missed
- **January 4, 2024**: Lynn Carrington documented 45 defects during snagging

Stage 12 missed over 50 defects including critical safety violations, demonstrating complete failure of your quality control process.

The widespread lack of technical knowledge across your organization, requiring customers to fight for basic surveyor checks and identify fundamental issues your staff miss, suggests homes are being built without proper qualified oversight - a systemic risk affecting all Crest properties.

### Inspection Failures Causing Further Delays
The failure of your Stage 12 inspection directly caused additional delays:
- **October 6**: Stage 12 declares "no further works"
- **October 25**: Trinity Rose finds garage DPC "less than half of NHBC's minimum required tolerance"
- **November 9, 2023**: Natalie Haigh claims will be "endeavouring to resolve" garage DPC by November 17
- **January 2024**: Still arguing front garage DPC doesn't need to meet NHBC standards
- **December 18**: Finally complete - 2.5 months after "passed" Stage 12

Had Stage 12 identified these issues, they would have been fixed in early October, allowing completion by October 31 as planned. Instead, your inspection failures added another 6 weeks of delays, compounding the financial harm and stress to our family.

The fundamental question remains: How did your build manager's "15 inspections" and Stage 12 inspection miss 50+ defects that an independent surveyor and homeowner easily found? Even after Trinity Rose identified the garage DPC as violating NHBC standards in October, your November 9 response was merely that you would be "endeavouring to resolve" it - weak language for a fundamental building regulation failure that should never have passed any of your claimed inspections.

### False Assurances
- **October 4, 2023**: I asked Natalie Haigh if guttering had been cleared of construction debris
- **October 4, 2023**: Natalie Haigh confirmed: "Yes, this has been done"
- **January 4, 2024**: Defect #41: Gutters full of building debris risking drainage system blockage
- **Evidence**: Drone photography and independent plumber confirmed gutters contained construction waste

## 3. Trinity Rose Payment and Verification Failure

Despite Paragraph 19 of the Reservation Agreement stating that Crest would instruct Trinity Rose, you failed to honor this legal obligation, leaving us to arrange it ourselves. This breach of the Reservation Agreement caused additional delays.

Crest Nicholson agreed to pay for the Trinity Rose assessment but subsequently:
- Failed to pay promptly, causing delays
- Refused to fund a follow-up inspection to verify remediation

**Result**: To this date, I have no verification that the serious defects identified by Trinity Rose have been properly addressed, including:
- Whether garage DPC was raised to required 150mm
- Whether soil vent pipe was properly connected
- Whether roof void was sealed against vermin

## 4. Additional Issues

### Ongoing Impact of Render Defects
While the render issue is subject to NHOS case NHOS-2024-000512, it continues to impact our daily life. Since autumn 2024, we have been unable to undertake any major garden improvements as we have been unable to have Crest address whatever underlying issue was the cause of the crack. This has left us in limbo for over 8 months, unable to properly enjoy or improve our outdoor space. The damage to the garden from scaffolding in 2024 has still not been rectified.

### Snagging Defects
Lynn Carrington documented 45 defects during January 2024 snagging, demonstrating systematic quality control failures.

### Water Pressure Issues - Dismissed then Proven
The property suffered from a banging water cylinder and repeatedly leaking dishwasher. Crest initially suggested our washing machine was the problem. However, when the water board attended (at Crest's request), they confirmed water pressure was at 8 bars entering the property - requiring Crest to install a pressure reducing valve. After I requested further investigation, a plumber installed a valve reducing pressure to 3 bars. Result: the banging ceased and, once the damaged door and dishwasher were replaced, no further leaks occurred. This demonstrates another instance where critical issues were only resolved because I refused to accept inadequate responses.

### Communication Failures
Analysis of correspondence shows I was required to send multiple emails to receive responses, with some delays exceeding reasonable timeframes.

## 5. Impact on Family Wellbeing

As with our previous property experience with Crest Nicholson, dealing with these ongoing issues has significantly affected the wellbeing of our entire family.

## 6. Pattern of Systematic Failures

This complaint represents nearly four years of systematic failures across two properties: two years at 25 Abbots Road culminating in a buyback, and now 18+ months at 10 Colt View with the same patterns. I have lost count of the hours spent away from family time writing emails, researching issues, and correcting Crest's mistakes.

This pattern of forcing customers to waste time and energy correcting Crest and fighting for basic accountability is not the behavior expected of a '5-star' builder. The same issues persist following Peter Truscott's retirement. Furthermore, Crest breached the confidentiality agreement regarding 25 Abbots Road by failing to provide a valid reason for refusing consent to discuss the agreement, as required under its terms. This breach prevented me from providing NHOS with complete pattern evidence across both properties.

Despite being aware of the extensive problems at 25 Abbots Road that necessitated a buyback, Crest did not implement procedures to ensure Plot 34 would not suffer similar issues. A senior manager explicitly promised us "there would be no repeat of 25 Abbots Road" - yet here we are documenting the same patterns of delays, defects, and poor communication.

When dealing with Crest's failures at 25 Abbots Road, we had no NHOS support yet still achieved a buyback due to the severity of the issues. With 10 Colt View, we do have NHOS support, and our complaint is nearing decision.

## Requirements for Resolution

I require the following within the 56-day period:

### 1. Comprehensive Written Response
A detailed response addressing:
- How 15 inspections plus Stage 12 missed critical defects
- Why false information was provided about gutter cleaning
- Explanation for 6-month completion delay
- Why verification of Trinity Rose remediation was refused

I require documentation of all 15 inspections claimed by your build manager, including dates, inspector names, and inspection reports, to understand how 50+ defects were missed.

Given that Stage 12 inspection - which we were advised was Crest's final quality assurance - declared 'no further works required' despite being conducted before carpets were installed, yet missed 50+ defects including critical NHBC violations found just 19 days later, I require evidence of the inspector's qualifications, training records, and the inspection checklist used.

### 2. Official Apology
A formal written apology, signed by yourself as CEO, acknowledging:
- Failure to deliver the property as promised
- Multiple inspection failures
- Provision of false information
- Failure to verify remediation

### 3. Financial Compensation
Payment of £8,136.87 representing additional mortgage costs incurred due to Crest Nicholson's delays.

### 4. Verification
Arrangement for independent verification, by a surveyor of my choosing and at Crest Nicholson's expense, that all defects identified by Trinity Rose have been properly remediated to the required NHBC standards.

## Next Steps

I trust this matter can be resolved without escalation to the New Homes Ombudsman Service. However, if this complaint is not handled in line with the NHOS timeframe, or if the response is not satisfactory, I will raise another complaint with the NHOS.

To be clear, I am not interested in:
- Non-apologies like "we're sorry you feel that way" - these are documented facts, not feelings
- Assurances that you "followed procedures" - your procedures failed to identify 50+ defects
- "Goodwill gestures" - I strongly object to NHBC standards required work being characterised as goodwill

This is not about feelings or perceptions. This is about measurable failures: 6 months of delays, 50+ missed defects, £8,136.87 in quantifiable financial harm, and a completion day so poorly handled that I had to personally call your Sales Director to obtain keys despite payment being confirmed by both solicitors.

As you were personally made aware on June 23, 2025, when I sent you the MJA report proving structural defects, these are not minor issues but systematic failures requiring executive accountability. I note that NHBC has been made aware of your written admission to NHOS regarding the use of 2014 standards on this 2023 build, and the characterisation of the rectification work as unnecessary, cosmetic, and a gesture of goodwill despite your own engineer's findings.

Given that my previous escalation to your office, which included the MJA report, resulted in a response from your Managing Director that misrepresented your engineer's findings despite you being personally provided with this report on June 23, 2025, I trust that this formal complaint will receive a response that is both factually accurate and directly addresses the requirements outlined. Please acknowledge receipt within 5 calendar days.

Yours sincerely,
Mr Taylor
