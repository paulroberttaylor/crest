## Total Project Cost: £27,000-£35,000

## "Pristine Finish" Standard Costs
When requiring property and grounds restored to "never happened" standard:

### Additional Requirements
- Professional landscaping restoration: £1,500-2,500
- Deep cleaning all paths/drives/boundaries: £500-800  
- Window cleaning (all windows): £200-300
- Fence/boundary cleaning: £300-500
- Garden restoration where scaffolding was: £1,000-2,000

- Damage contingency: £1,000-2,000

### Pristine Standard Total: £35,000-40,000

## Multiple Property Exposure (Pristine Standard)
- 3 other properties confirmed affected: £105,000-£120,000
- If all 66 properties affected: £2.31M-£2.64M

## Key Risks
- Hidden damage only visible after render removal
- Reputation impact if work looks "patched"
- Neighbors will ask questions during visible work
- Poor finish signals "problem house" to buyers

## Strategic Implications
- Buyback may be cheaper than remediation + reputation damage
- Work cannot be hidden from development residents
- Sets precedent for other affected properties
