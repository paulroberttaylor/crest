I advised her of your message this morning - that you had been informed that Crest had decided not to pay our fees.\r\n\r\nShe has clarified Crest's position - that they will pay the 2,500 for Wednesday's inspection, but that it will be down to you to pay the 1,500 fee for work in relation to 25 Abbots Road.\r\n\r\nI advised I wasn't happy with that, as we will be left 1500 out of pocket.  She then consulted her director but I have not been given any further clarity on the position regarding that element of our fee.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am bringing this to your attention as, if this does not accord with your understanding of the situation, you may wish to contact her - donna.hack@crestnicholson.com.\r\n\r\nAs it stands we will attend on Wednesday, but I would like the other aspect of the fees accrued to be sorted out with Crest, as they relate to your position with 25 Abbots Road and therefore, Crest should be covering all your expenses in supporting you to get to your resolution on that property.\r\n\r\nKind regards, Richard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nSent: 09 October 2023 08:30\r\nTo: Richard Kirby <r.kirby@trinity-rose.co.uk>\r\nSubject: Urgent: Re: appointment on Wednesday\r\n\r\nGood morning Richard,\r\n\r\nPlease could you confirm whether Crest has contacted you since our last email? They are claiming that they have instructed you.\r\n\r\nThe agreement with Crest was that you were to go in once the property is build complete. I have raised several times that there is boxing which is visibly out of square. In my opinion, until that is rectified, the house can not be considered build complete, ready to be moved into.\r\n\r\nCrest agreed to pay your fee, as per the section of email sent to you.

They require\r\nthe mortgage redemption statement and proof of non-portability, therefore\r\nneed to pay for Serhan's time.\r\n\r\nI have a transcript of a call with Adrian Sims, the Managing Director, from\r\nseveral months ago when this entire situation was first being discussed,\r\nwho assured us that we would need to be happy with the home before\r\ncompletion. If this is not going to be the case, this needs to be recorded\r\nas a discrepancy and is quite serious for someone at his level to state\r\nthis in a conversation then do the exact opposite (I am aware that\r\nconversations recorded for personal use can be shared with legal\r\nrepresentatives but no one else, and I can confirm that they have not been):\r\n\r\nMy first thing is that, obviously we made an offer as a buyback for your\r\n> home.

I advised her of your message this morning - that you had been informed that Crest had decided not to pay our fees.\r\n\r\nShe has clarified Crest's position - that they will pay the 2,500 for Wednesday's inspection, but that it will be down to you to pay the 1,500 fee for work in relation to 25 Abbots Road.\r\n\r\nI advised I wasn't happy with that, as we will be left 1500 out of pocket.  She then consulted her director but I have not been given any further clarity on the position regarding that element of our fee.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am bringing this to your attention as, if this does not accord with your understanding of the situation, you may wish to contact her - donna.hack@crestnicholson.com.\r\n\r\nAs it stands we will attend on Wednesday, but I would like the other aspect of the fees accrued to be sorted out with Crest, as they relate to your position with 25 Abbots Road and therefore, Crest should be covering all your expenses in supporting you to get to your resolution on that property.\r\n\r\nKind regards, Richard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nSent: 09 October 2023 08:30\r\nTo: Richard Kirby <r.kirby@trinity-rose.co.uk>\r\nSubject: Urgent: Re: appointment on Wednesday\r\n\r\nGood morning Richard,\r\n\r\nPlease could you confirm whether Crest has contacted you since our last email? They are claiming that they have instructed you.\r\n\r\nThe agreement with Crest was that you were to go in once the property is build complete. I have raised several times that there is boxing which is visibly out of square. In my opinion, until that is rectified, the house can not be considered build complete, ready to be moved into.\r\n\r\nCrest agreed to pay your fee, as per the section of email sent to you.

Additionally, they are charging\r\nresidents \u00a35,000 per year to empty what are essentially public bins. This\r\namount is extortionate, even if residents were responsible for them.\r\nHowever, these bins would ordinarily be emptied by the council. As the open\r\narea is still not yet suitable for council adoption, the council has\r\nunderstandably not taken responsibility for them. This responsibility\r\nshould rest with Crest.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if you could ensure these bins are emptied by a Crest\r\nrepresentative or an appointed company and that SPAM is instructed to\r\nremove this fee from the estate charges.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this as a formal complaint dated today, and ensure it is\r\naddressed accordingly as per NHOS guidelines and timelines.\r\nOpen Area Landscaping\r\n\r\nRegarding the open area, you assured me that the gap providing access to\r\nthe farmer\u2019s road would be filled with plants by the end of 2024. This was\r\nconfirmed in your email dated Monday, 14th October 2024, at 18:26, in\r\nresponse to my email of Wednesday, 4th September 2024, at 11:30. However,\r\n88 days have now passed since your confirmation, and 128 days since my\r\ninitial email complaining about this, with no action taken.\r\n\r\nAs this matter has exceeded the 56-day threshold, I am prepared to escalate\r\nthis to the NHOS. Before doing so, please could you provide an update on\r\nwhen this will be completed. I assume the farmer will be liaised with to\r\nhave the railings removed which prevented further access to Crest, after\r\nthe previous attempt to block it was removed by Crests' groundworkers.\r\nPath Issue\r\n\r\nI was informed by the NHOS that you would be contacting me regarding the\r\npath linking both developments, which you have stated Crest wi",

I advised her of your message this morning - that you had been informed that Crest had decided not to pay our fees.\r\n\r\nShe has clarified Crest's position - that they will pay the 2,500 for Wednesday's inspection, but that it will be down to you to pay the 1,500 fee for work in relation to 25 Abbots Road.\r\n\r\nI advised I wasn't happy with that, as we will be left 1500 out of pocket.  She then consulted her director but I have not been given any further clarity on the position regarding that element of our fee.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am bringing this to your attention as, if this does not accord with your understanding of the situation, you may wish to contact her - donna.hack@crestnicholson.com.\r\n\r\nAs it stands we will attend on Wednesday, but I would like the other aspect of the fees accrued to be sorted out with Crest, as they relate to your position with 25 Abbots Road and therefore, Crest should be covering all your expenses in supporting you to get to your resolution on that property.\r\n\r\nKind regards, Richard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nSent: 09 October 2023 08:30\r\nTo: Richard Kirby <r.kirby@trinity-rose.co.uk>\r\nSubject: Urgent: Re: appointment on Wednesday\r\n\r\nGood morning Richard,\r\n\r\nPlease could you confirm whether Crest has contacted you since our last email?

In my opinion, until that is rectified, the house can not be considered build complete, ready to be moved into.\r\n\r\nCrest agreed to pay your fee, as per the section of email sent to you.

They require\r\nthe mortgage redemption statement and proof of non-portability, therefore\r\nneed to pay for Serhan's time.\r\n\r\nI have a transcript of a call with Adrian Sims, the Managing Director, from\r\nseveral months ago when this entire situation was first being discussed,\r\nwho assured us that we would need to be happy with the home before\r\ncompletion. If this is not going to be the case, this needs to be recorded\r\nas a discrepancy and is quite serious for someone at his level to state\r\nthis in a conversation then do the exact opposite (I am aware that\r\nconversations recorded for personal use can be shared with legal\r\nrepresentatives but no one else, and I can confirm that they have not been):\r\n\r\nMy first thing is that, obviously we made an offer as a buyback for your\r\n> home.

I advised her of your message this morning - that you had been informed that Crest had decided not to pay our fees.\r\n\r\nShe has clarified Crest's position - that they will pay the 2,500 for Wednesday's inspection, but that it will be down to you to pay the 1,500 fee for work in relation to 25 Abbots Road.\r\n\r\nI advised I wasn't happy with that, as we will be left 1500 out of pocket.  She then consulted her director but I have not been given any further clarity on the position regarding that element of our fee.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am bringing this to your attention as, if this does not accord with your understanding of the situation, you may wish to contact her - donna.hack@crestnicholson.com.\r\n\r\nAs it stands we will attend on Wednesday, but I would like the other aspect of the fees accrued to be sorted out with Crest, as they relate to your position with 25 Abbots Road and therefore, Crest should be covering all your expenses in supporting you to get to your resolution on that property.\r\n\r\nKind regards, Richard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nSent: 09 October 2023 08:30\r\nTo: Richard Kirby <r.kirby@trinity-rose.co.uk>\r\nSubject: Urgent: Re: appointment on Wednesday\r\n\r\nGood morning Richard,\r\n\r\nPlease could you confirm whether Crest has contacted you since our last email? They are claiming that they have instructed you.\r\n\r\nThe agreement with Crest was that you were to go in once the property is build complete. I have raised several times that there is boxing which is visibly out of square. In my opinion, until that is rectified, the house can not be considered build complete, ready to be moved into.\r\n\r\nCrest agreed to pay your fee, as per the section of email sent to you. They are now going back on that, and not willing to do so.\r\n\r\nWe were not aware that that time was going",

As you may be aware the reservation meeting has been booked in for this Thursday so I am keen to ensure the Reservation Agreement is in agreed form by then.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to see that they have relented on the exchange point. The lack of multiple surveys is disappointing, but I have confidence in Taylor Rose that they will look after you when they do their final survey.\r\n\r\nThey are not willing to reduce the price.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for your instructions.\r\n\r\nI should mention that I must drive to a London court to urgently apply for an family law injunction. I expect this will be today, if not tomorrow. I am afraid this may make me slow to reply to emails.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSerhan Handani LL.B (Hons), LL.M\r\nPartner\r\n[untitled-2-45]\r\nUnit 10 Vicarage Farm Busines Park, Winchester Road, Fair Oak, SO50 7HD\r\n141 Elm Grove, Southsea, Hampshire, PO5 1HR\r\nT: 02382 514300 E: sh@bramsdonandchilds.com<mailto:sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nWebsite: www.bramsdonandchilds.com<http://www.bramsdonandchilds.com/>\r\n[facebook]Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/bramsdonandchilds> [twitter]  @Bramsdon_Childs<https://twitter.com",

The initial report was done and those issues have been raised with Crest. That appears to meet that requirement.\r\n\r\nSnagging usually happens after completion, and you could obtain a snagging inspection if you wish. That is quite normal with new builds but is outside the scope of the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all of the above is that this effectively puts you in a position of usual purchaser of a new build property but with the benefit of having had a surveyor go in at an earlier stage. If you wish to involve Trinity Rose further, that would be at your cost, unless Crest offer to pay for it (which seems unlikely).\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSerhan Handani LL.B (Hons), LL.M\r\nPartner\r\n[untitled-2-45]\r\n\r\nADVANCE NOTICE OF LEAVE \u2013 28th November \u2013 11th December 2023\r\n\r\nUnit 10 Vicarage Farm Business Park, Winchester Road, Fair Oak, SO50 7HD\r\n141 Elm Grove, Southsea, Hampshire, PO5 1HR\r\nT: 02382 514300 E: sh@bramsdonandchilds.com<mailto:sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nWebsite: www.bramsdonandchilds.com<http://www.bramsdonandchilds.com/>\r\n[facebook]Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/bramsdonandchilds> [twitter]  @Bramsdon_Childs<https://twitter.com/Bramsdon_Childs> [linkedin]  LinkedIn\r\n[cid:image005.jpg@01DA1D52.FA9FA060]     [Home]\r\n\r\nAuthorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (under no 47593)\r\nThe information contained in this message may be confidential and is intended for the addressee only.

Additionally, they are charging\r\nresidents \u00a35,000 per year to empty what are essentially public bins. This\r\namount is extortionate, even if residents were responsible for them.\r\nHowever, these bins would ordinarily be emptied by the council. As the open\r\narea is still not yet suitable for council adoption, the council has\r\nunderstandably not taken responsibility for them. This responsibility\r\nshould rest with Crest.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if you could ensure these bins are emptied by a Crest\r\nrepresentative or an appointed company and that SPAM is instructed to\r\nremove this fee from the estate charges.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this as a formal complaint dated today, and ensure it is\r\naddressed accordingly as per NHOS guidelines and timelines.\r\nOpen Area Landscaping\r\n\r\nRegarding the open area, you assured me that the gap providing access to\r\nthe farmer\u2019s road would be filled with plants by the end of 2024. This was\r\nconfirmed in your email dated Monday, 14th October 2024, at 18:26, in\r\nresponse to my email of Wednesday, 4th September 2024, at 11:30. However,\r\n88 days have now passed since your confirmation, and 128 days since my\r\ninitial email complaining about this, with no action taken.\r\n\r\nAs this matter has exceeded the 56-day threshold, I am prepared to escalate\r\nthis to the NHOS. Before doing so, please could you provide an update on\r\nwhen this will be completed. I assume the farmer will be liaised with to\r\nhave the railings removed which prevented further access to Crest, after\r\nthe previous attempt to block it was removed by Crests' groundworkers.\r\nPath Issue\r\n\r\nI was informed by the NHOS that you would be contacting me regarding the\r\npath linking both developments, which you have stated Crest wi",

I received confirmation this morning that they have had no\r\ncontact from Crest Nicholson.\r\n\r\nI have already forwarded their fee structure to you and received\r\nconfirmation via email last week, which I subsequently conveyed to Trinity\r\nRose.  It is now Crest's responsibility to contact Trinity Rose directly\r\nfor both instruction and finalisation of payment terms (and to determine if\r\nan alternative surveyor needs to be found). They require a confirmation by\r\nthe close of business today; otherwise, they will not be available for the\r\nsurvey on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nI also have the following specific questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - Your internal surveyor has yet to complete their assessment of plot\r\n   34; how can we proceed under the assumption that only minor issues will be\r\n   present?\r\n   - Has the issue with the kitchen boxing been resolved?\r\n   - We are still waiting for your response concerning the garage personnel\r\n   doors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Paragraph 19 a of the signed reservation agreement, Crest must\r\nconfirm the property as \"build complete\" before we can arrange our own\r\nsurvey. It's therefore premature to schedule a survey with only one day\r\navailable for resolving stage 12 issues.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this email as soon as possible and include our solicitors\r\nin your reply. On a related note, our solicitors have informed us they have\r\nyet to receive payment, despite multiple reminders.\r\n\r\nMr Taylor\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nDate: Mon, 9 Oct 2023 at 08:40\r\nSubject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: Plot 34 Albany Road\r\nTo: Natalie Haigh <Natalie.Haigh@crestnicholson.com>\r\nCc: Hannah Rafferty <hr@bramsdonandchilds.com>, Serhan Handani <\r\nsh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning,\r\n\r\nAll communication regarding this should be going through our solicitor.\r\n\r\nI will be contacting them this morning to contact Crest's solicitors with",

We could not have\r\nmade it any clearer to Mr Sims and Peter Truscott (CEO) that the delays are\r\njeopardising everything, and said this multiple times.  Please could you\r\nadvise? We realistically need them to change the purchasing price to\r\nreflect this, and be aware that this could change again at any time.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning Natalie,\r\n\r\nThank you for requesting a retraction over the weekend of the email sent\r\nafter our meeting on Albany Road on Friday. I'm grateful that you said that\r\nyou could understand why we would be disappointed, and that is why you\r\nworded it in that way. The offer for a meal was a kind gesture, but not\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the email was still sent, I would be grateful if you could confirm\r\nfor us, to all adressees, that the content of it could have been worded in\r\na way which did not paint my husband in a negative light, however well\r\nintentioned it was.\r\n\r\nI believe that since you and Steve have not been made fully aware of the\r\nsituation, it is not possible for you to understand the frustration we\r\ncontinue to have with the way we are being treated by Crest. Mr Sims stated\r\nin his email of 1st June that there needs to not be multiple lines of\r\ncommunication, however unless everyone is aware of all facts, this can not\r\nhappen.  Going forwards, it is essential that Crest communicates correctly\r\nwithin the organisation.\r\n\r\nI will answer each of the points:\r\n\r\n-- They advised we have wasted their time as they believed the property\r\nwould be pre plastered, they wanted to check this today, as this is the\r\nmain issue in their current property.\r\n\r\nOur time is not being used productively. Not only do we still have to chase\r\nat",

We're obviously not in the\r\nposition of being able to pay for litigation, we just want to move in and\r\nforget they exist, but they're making it as difficult as possible.\r\n\r\nI did reiterate your concerns to Natalie Haigh that you have still not been\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHannah,\r\n\r\nI think the most important issue now is addressing the completion date.  It\r\nsounds from Serhan's email that while the 25th October is only 4 working\r\ndays away from the end of the month, and because they can decide not to\r\nsell to us, we don't have any say in when completion would be? They're\r\nbeing difficult just because they can be.\r\n\r\nThe problem that we now have is that the house was supposed to be in a\r\nstate where Trinity Rose could go in, but even Ollie from Trinity Rose told\r\nthem it isn't ready. The issue I told them about at the start of summer\r\nstill won't meet NHBC standards, and this has been signed off by their\r\nprofessional snagger, and building manager.\r\n\r\nI suspect at this point that they won't even be ready by the end of the\r\nmonth anyway, given that Trinity Rose has to be booked in again to perform\r\nthe official first survey once they have installed the carpets, and he\r\nalready found lots of items to be addressed within 15 minutes of being in\r\nthe property. Once those have been rectified, he then needs to go in again\r\nto verify that they did what they were supposed to do.\r\n\r\nNatalie Haigh is going to be emailing you regarding the rest of the\r\nprocess, and I am going to chase the mortgage company again this morning.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nOn Thu, 12 Oct 2023, 8:55 am Serhan Handani, <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Good morning Paul,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> I apologise for my delay.

We could not have\r\nmade it any clearer to Mr Sims and Peter Truscott (CEO) that the delays are\r\njeopardising everything, and said this multiple times.  Please could you\r\nadvise? We realistically need them to change the purchasing price to\r\nreflect this, and be aware that this could change again at any time.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning Natalie,\r\n\r\nThank you for requesting a retraction over the weekend of the email sent\r\nafter our meeting on Albany Road on Friday. I'm grateful that you said that\r\nyou could understand why we would be disappointed, and that is why you\r\nworded it in that way. The offer for a meal was a kind gesture, but not\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the email was still sent, I would be grateful if you could confirm\r\nfor us, to all adressees, that the content of it could have been worded in\r\na way which did not paint my husband in a negative light, however well\r\nintentioned it was.\r\n\r\nI believe that since you and Steve have not been made fully aware of the\r\nsituation, it is not possible for you to understand the frustration we\r\ncontinue to have with the way we are being treated by Crest. Mr Sims stated\r\nin his email of 1st June that there needs to not be multiple lines of\r\ncommunication, however unless everyone is aware of all facts, this can not\r\nhappen.  Going forwards, it is essential that Crest communicates correctly\r\nwithin the organisation.\r\n\r\nI will answer each of the points:\r\n\r\n-- They advised we have wasted their time as they believed the property\r\nwould be pre plastered, they wanted to check this today, as this is the\r\nmain issue in their current property.\r\n\r\nOur time is not being used productively. Not only do we still have to chase\r\nat",
        "Subject: Re: Plot 34 Crest\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\nTo: Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\nDate: Wed, 7 Jun 2023 09:42:58 +0100\nGood morning Serhan,\r\n\r\nWhile it's great news that they are agreeing to do the exchange after the\r\nproperty has been checked, the fact that we have reduced borrowing and\r\nincreased monthly payments because of Mr Sims will mean that they are\r\nmaking the entire transaction untenable, to the point where it may be\r\nnecessary to go ahead and do the work, losing their non-disclosure\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nThey need to be reasonable, since their actions, or lack thereof, is what\r\nhas put us in this position.  We can not take out a mortgage based on the\r\ncurrent borrowing and interest rates unless they are willing to cover the\r\ndifference, which in the bigger picture is pennies to them.\r\n\r\nIt needs to be made clear that we told them this would happen if they\r\ndelayed the process, and is a direct result of Mr Sims not doing what he\r\npromised.  The longer this takes going back and forth it could become\r\nworse, and we need to reserve tomorrow to get our mortgage advisor to lock\r\nin a rate.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your work on this.  It comes down to whether they want to\r\ndo the work or not. There is nothing else to purchase after they made us\r\nlose the property we found and we can't control what the mortgage lenders\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 7 Jun 2023 at 09:08, Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Good morning both,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Please see the response below from Crest\u2019s solicitors:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Exchange*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *If this is important to your clients, my client is content for contracts\r\n> for the sale of Plot 34 to be exchanged after the Taylor Rose survey with\r\n> completion 14 days after exchange. *\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *My client will not, however, agree to three separate surveys but will\r\n> agree, as previously confirmed, to one jointly instructed survey once the\r\n> property is build complete.*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Price*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *My client is not willing to change the purchase price that they had\r\n> agreed with your client, subject to contract, for the new property.*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>",

We spoke to our mortgage\r\nadvisor again yesterday, and it looks like the interest rates are only\r\ngoing to keep going up.  Crest has put us in this situation, and unless\r\nthey compromise (they offered us approximately \u00a320k less for 25 Abbots Road\r\nthan the agreed estate agents valuations average) they are making it\r\nimpossible to continue.\r\n\r\nWe have done literally everything we have been told to do by Crest, even\r\nwhen we keep being treated in the manner we explained in your office.\r\n\r\nAs you are on leave next week, they really need to decide what their\r\npriorities are.  By the time you are back it could be that we are\r\ncompletely priced out of the purchase, and therefore buyback.\r\n\r\nMany thanks again,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 7 Jun 2023 at 09:46, Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> I shall ask them to reconsider now.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Kind regards,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Serhan Handani LL.B (Hons), LL.M*\r\n>\r\n> *Partner*\r\n>\r\n> [image: untitled-2-45]\r\n>\r\n> Unit 10 Vicarage Farm Busines Park, Winchester Road, Fair Oak, SO50 7HD\r\n>\r\n> 141 Elm Grove, Southsea, Hampshire, PO5 1HR\r\n>\r\n> T: 02382 514300 E: sh@bramsdonandchilds.com\r\n>\r\n> Website: www.bramsdonandchilds.com\r\n>\r\n> [image: facebook]Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/bramsdonandchilds> [image:\r\n> twitter] *@*Bramsdon_Childs <https://twitter.com/Bramsdon_Childs> [image:\r\n> linkedin] LinkedIn\r\n>\r\n>      [image: Home]\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (under no\r\n> 47593)\r\n>\r\n> The information contained in this message may be confidential and is\r\n> intended for the addressee only.

The confidentiality clause is in standard wording and appears clear to me. You cannot discuss the terms of the settlement.\r\n\r\nI shall await the documents from Crest though as they may make revisions.\r\n\r\nThis agreement is entirely separate to the conveyancing documents. They will not refer to any aspect of this dispute or the settlement. This is a settlement between you and Crest and must be recorded in writing.\r\n\r\nIt is my strong advice to you that the settlement proposed by Crest is a reasonable one and their terms are usual and reasonable.\r\n\r\nTo your last point, I should be clear. The confidentiality will not cover future events. That is not possible in law. If further issues arose, this would not be covered, and you are free to discuss. It is also always the case that fundamental breaches of contract will affect the validity of that contract and the terms. A clause would not be included to this effect as it operates as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nI will await the documents from Crest and discuss with you once received. I would repeat that I consider the offer you have been made to be unlikely to be bettered in any litigation.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSerhan Handani, LL.B (Hons), LL.M\r\nAssociate Solicitor \u2013 Head of Litigation\r\n[untitled-2-45]\r\nUnit 10 Vicarage Farm Business Park, Winchester Road, Fair Oak, SO50 7HD\r\nT: 02382 514300 F: 02392 893777  E: sh@bramsdonandchilds.com<mailto:sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\nWebsite: www.bramsdonandchilds.com<http://www.bramsdonandchilds.com/>\r\n[facebook]Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/bramsdonandchilds> [twitter]  @Bramsdon_Childs<https://twitter.com/Bramsdon_Childs> [linkedin]  LinkedIn\r\n[cid:image005.jpg@01D963BF.A2746260]     [Home]\r\n\r\n ***WE ARE RECRUITING A QUALIFIED CONVEYANCER AND A FAMILY LAWYER.\r\nPLEASE CONTACT jo@bramsdonandchilds.com<mailto:jo@bramsdonandchilds.com> FOR MORE INFORMATION***\r\n\r\nAuthorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (under no 47593)\r\nThe informa",

They are however not going to provide it. Their logic is that we\r\nwanted to exchange and complete as soon as possible, which has no relevance\r\nto the certification, but is somehow being used to justify ignoring the\r\nlegal contract.\r\n\r\nThey also claim that the work was done according to the satisfaction of the\r\nsurveyor but can't prove it, since the final certification was never given.\r\n\r\nIt was a requirement as part of the contract for 10 Colt View, and I do not\r\nunderstand why they feel they can pick and choose what they will abide by\r\nand what they will not.\r\n\r\nThey are also, despite it being listed in the reservation agreement,\r\nrefusing to put a second instance of incorrect DPC right, claiming that the\r\nNHBC standards are only guidelines.  A guideline does not state a minimum\r\nmeasurement for tolerances.  DPC tolerances are a part of the NHBC's\r\ntechnical standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Contract for 10 Colt View*\r\n\r\n1.14.2. The Seller has undertaken these works (if any) and, if appropriate,\r\n> the surveyor has certified that these works (if any) have been\r\n> satisfactorily completed.\r\n\r\n1.16.6. Any damage or defects which fall within NHBC tolerances.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Reservation Agreement:*\r\n\r\n19. Key principles surrounding the structural survey by Trinity Rose:\r\n> a.

I have fully adhered to my obligations under the agreement,\r\nbut the same cannot be said for Crest Nicholson.\r\n\r\nAs the agreement explicitly states, consent to discuss its terms *must not\r\nbe unreasonably withheld.* Crest has failed to provide any reasonable\r\njustification for its refusal, beyond a blanket denial, despite multiple\r\nrequests. As such, Crest is not upholding the terms of its own agreement.\r\n\r\nThe continued lack of response only reinforces that Crest is not committed\r\nto the agreement it drafted. Without compliance from both parties, the\r\nenforceability of the agreement itself is called into question.\r\n\r\nI expect a response without further delay.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor\r\n\r\nOn Thu, 19 Dec 2024 at 10:02, Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Dear Mr. Foyle,\r\n>\r\n> I am writing to address once more the matter of the NDA and Crest\u2019s\r\n> refusal to grant permission for me to discuss its contents with the NHOS.\r\n> As per the agreement, consent to such discussions \"shall not be\r\n> unreasonably withheld.\"\r\n>\r\n> Despite repeated requests, you have provided no reason\u2014let alone a valid\r\n> justification\u2014for this refusal.

I shall consider it in detail when I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrest have not agreed to cover all my costs. I am concerned that my costs will be significant as you are effectively asking me to bring your claims formally (albeit not in court) rather than simply advise on the agreement reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can see that they have agreed to cover the costs in reviewing and agreeing the memorandum only. They are not agreeing to cover legal costs in further negotiation or litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage I would estimate my costs to negotiate this further will be in the region of \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,000 plus VAT but may be significantly more depending on how the case proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy preliminary view, which I believe I have shared with you by telephone, is that further compensation will be very difficult to justify in law. As far as I could tell, Crest\u2019s offer ensures that you have not financially lost any sums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that Crest are not willing to pay more than they have already offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot see legal justification for your previous expenses on your property (such as mortgage payments and utilities) to be covered. These are expenses you would have borne irrespective of Crest\u2019s actions and are almost certainly unclaimable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am out of the office this afternoon so I am afraid I cannot call you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSerhan Handani, LL.B (Hons), LL.M\r\n\r\nAssociate Solicitor \u2013 Head of Litigation\r\n\r\n[untitled-2-45]\r\n\r\nUnit 10 Vicarage Farm Business Park, Winchester Road, Fair Oak, SO50 7HD\r\n\r\nT: 02382 514300 F: 02392 893777  E: sh@bramsdonandchilds.com<mailto:sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>\r\n\r\nWebsite: www.bramsdonandchilds.com<http://www.bramsdonandc",

        "Subject: Fwd: Urgent: Re: appointment on Wednesday\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\nTo: Hannah Rafferty <hr@bramsdonandchilds.com>, Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>, \r\n\tJade Taylor <jade.millington@hotmail.co.uk>\nDate: Thu, 30 Nov 2023 15:52:51 +0000\nGood afternoon Hannah,\r\n\r\nPlease see this email from Richard Kirby on Mon, 9 Oct 2023 at 16:03.  This\r\nline is the important part:\r\n\r\nAs it stands we will attend on Wednesday, but I would like the other aspect\r\n> of the fees accrued to be sorted out with Crest, as they relate to *your\r\n> position with 25 Abbots Road and therefore, Crest should be covering *\r\n> *all** your expenses in supporting you to get to your resolution on that\r\n> property*.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this line from the email to him on 09 October 2023 08:30:\r\n\r\n*We were not aware that that time was going to be billed so it was not put\r\n> into the buy back agreement, which they are now falling back to.*\r\n\r\n\r\nHe knew that he had not told us about this extra fee.  If he had done so\r\nearlier, we would have been able to ask Serhan to add it to the agreement.\r\n\r\nHe has already agreed that this is not something he ever expected us to\r\npay, but is using it to prevent us from completing.  Neither Jade nor I are\r\nin a position to negotiate this fee between Trinity Rose and Crest\r\nNicholson, and it's unacceptable to pretend otherwise.  This 'fee' has no\r\nbearing whatsoever on completing the work he has already been paid for by\r\nCrest on 10 Colt View, as it relates to payment he feels he is owed for 25\r\nAbbots Road.\r\n\r\nRichard has never even produced an invoice or accounted for when and where\r\nthis time was spent.  If Crest hasn't been given an invoice, what are they\r\nsupposed to pay?  Jade also advised Richard to ensure any and all fees were\r\nincluded in the quote he gave to Crest. If he didn't do so, I fail to see\r\nwhat else either of us could have done.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Richard Kirby <r.kirby@trinity-rose.co.uk>\r\nDate: Mon, 9 Oct 2023 at 16:03\r\nSubject: Re: Urgent: Re: appointment on Wednesday\r\nTo: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>, Jade Taylor <\r\njade.millington@hotmail.co.uk>\r\n\r\n\r\n[image: -]\r\n\r\nFurther to our earlier exchange of emails, I have just had a call "
