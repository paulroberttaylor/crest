## Key Observations

1. **Extended Complaint Timeline**: The complaint process has been ongoing for over 17 months (January 2024 - May 2025) with no apparent final resolution despite a "final response" in January 2025.

2. **Settlement Not Final**: Despite a signed settlement agreement in September 2024, complaints and updates continued through May 2025.

3. **Multiple Issues**: Documents reference various problems including:
   - Initial snag list items
   - Water pressure issues
   - Dishwasher problems
   - Render/construction defects
   - Legal contract disputes

4. **Escalation to Ombudsman**: NHOS (New Homes Ombudsman Service) involvement from August 2024 indicates escalation beyond Crest Nicholson's internal complaint process.

5. **Pattern of Responses**: Crest follows a structured complaint process:
   - Acknowledgement
   - Pathway to resolution
   - Assessment and response
   - Interim updates
   - Final response (though not necessarily final resolution)
