# CEO Letter - Strategic Buyback Approach (Post-NHOS Final Decision)

**To be sent AFTER:**
- Final NHOS decision published
- Formal apology received
- CEO complaint response (or 56-day silence)

---

Dear Mr Clark,

Following NHOS-2024-000512's final decision confirming structural defects, I write regarding the path forward.

After four years across two of your properties, my family's health has reached breaking point. Yesterday's prescription of antidepressants following an emergency GP appointment underscores that prolonged remediation works are no longer viable for us.

Given:
- The NHOS decision upholding all aspects of my complaint  
- My outstanding CEO complaint for £9,131.07
- NHBC's ongoing investigation into building standards
- Crest's written admission of using 2014 standards on my 2022/2023 build
- The question of whether outdated standards were applied solely to my property or across all 66 homes
- At least three other properties exhibiting identical render defects and missing movement joints
- Our previous experience at 25 Abbots Road

I note that Crest has previously demonstrated pragmatic decision-making when faced with complex situations involving structural issues and family welfare.

I would welcome your thoughts on how we might resolve this matter in a way that recognizes both the severity of the situation and our family's inability to endure another extended remediation process.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Taylor

**Strategy Notes:**
- "path forward" - open-ended
- "pragmatic decision-making" - references buyback without saying it
- "resolve this matter" - lets them propose solution
- "complex situations" - hints at previous £690k resolution
- No threats, just facts and history
