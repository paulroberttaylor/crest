# URGENT: Buyback Request - Immediate Response Required Today

**Date: July 23, 2025**  
**To: Martyn Clark (CEO), Mark Foyle, Charlie Joseph**  
**Subject: URGENT - Buyback Resolution Required Today**

Dear Martyn, Mark and Charlie,

Our buyer has withdrawn. We have a house we want to buy. We need your commitment TODAY to enable us to proceed.

## The Situation

1. **NHBC has confirmed** (letter received today) you built using 2014 standards without permission on a 2022-registered property
2. **Weber confirms** the NHOS-mandated work will "undoubtedly destroy" the wall faces
3. **You falsely claimed** NHBC "signed off" the property - NHBC states they don't do this
4. **We cannot re-market** - we're not going through this again

## Your Easy Exit

**Buyback at £700,000** (the offer we just lost)

In return, you get:
- NHOS complaint withdrawn (saving you from impossible remediation)
- Complete confidentiality (no one learns about the 2014 standards fraud)
- No destructive work that neighbors will question
- No media campaign, no regulatory complaints, no shareholder notifications
- Clean, quiet resolution

## The Alternative

If we don't receive your commitment by 5pm today:
- We proceed with the media campaign tomorrow
- Every Albany Road owner learns about the 2014 standards
- NHBC investigates all 66 homes
- Trading Standards investigates the fraud
- The story goes national

## What We Need Today

A simple email by 5pm stating:
"Crest Nicholson agrees in principle to purchase 10 Colt View at £700,000. Formal terms to follow within 48 hours."

This allows us to secure our onward purchase. Without it, we have nothing to lose and will proceed with full exposure.

## The Choice

You can resolve this quietly today for £700k, or face the consequences of your fraud being exposed tomorrow. The NHBC letter proves everything. Weber proves the remediation is impossible. Your own emails prove the misrepresentation.

**5pm today.** After that, we go public.

**PS**: This isn't a negotiation. We've lost our buyer because of your defective property. You've been caught using wrong standards and making false claims. £700k is the clean exit price. Take it or face the alternative.
