# State of Play - July 22, 2025

## Current Situation

### Property Status
1. **10 Colt View**: 
   - You have a £700k offer on your house
   - NHOS case is NOT public - buyers don't know
   - MJA report says cosmetic only, no structural issues
   - House is perfectly sellable

2. **New Property**:
   - You've offered £478,500 on new house
   - Awaiting seller's response
   - Mortgage is portable (Vodafone default won't affect it)

### NHOS Case (NHOS-2024-000512)
- **Draft Decision**: UPHELD (July 15, 2025)
- **Final Decision Due**: July 29, 2025
- **Requirement**: Crest MUST implement MJA recommendations
- **Problem**: Weber confirms this work will destroy the block faces

### CEO Complaint (Separate from NHOS)
- **Sent**: July 8, 2025
- **Demanding**: £8,136.87 + apology + verification
- **Response Due**: By August 14, 2025
- **Next Step**: Can file new NHOS complaint after response

### Key Conflict
- NHOS orders work that must be done
- Weber says this work causes "more harm than good"
- But property remains sellable (cosmetic issues only per MJA)

## Strategy Going Forward

### Immediate Plan
1. **Proceed with house sale/purchase**
   - Complete on both properties
   - Port mortgage successfully
   - Move family to safety

2. **Let Crest respond by August 14**
   - Don't chase or pressure
   - Whatever they offer, it becomes basis for new complaint

3. **After moving**:
   - File second NHOS complaint (no urgency)
   - Fight from position of complete safety
   - Let process take as long as needed

### Key Advantages
- Not trapped in Crest property
- No desperation or urgency
- Can fight purely for accountability
- Crest won't know you've moved

### What Crest Doesn't Know
1. You have a buyer at £700k
2. Your mortgage is portable despite default
3. You're buying another house
4. You'll soon be completely free

### The Weber Evidence
- Proves Crest's "solution" is destructive
- But doesn't affect saleability (buyers won't know)
- Useful for future complaints about their conduct
- Shows they were planning to ambush you

### Vodafone Default
- Letter sent requesting removal due to exceptional circumstances
- GP writing supporting letter about 4-year housing crisis
- Default already paid (£156)
- Mortgage broker says portable mortgage unaffected

### GP Medical Letters
- Writing to Vodafone: Supporting default removal due to crisis
- Writing to Crest: Recommending buyback for family's health
- Emphasizes this is second consecutive defective Crest property
- Cites Weber evidence that repairs would cause more harm

### Other Active Matters
- **NHBC Investigation**: Ongoing - Crest used 2014 standards on 2023 build
- **Held Emails**: Charlie Joseph remediation requirements + CEO/Chairman buyback hint
- **Reference Point**: 25 Abbots Road buyback was £690k (sets precedent)
- **Current Mortgage**: £477k on 10 Colt View
- **Financial Position**: Clean except bed contract (£161/month until Dec)

## Timeline
- **Now - July 29**: Wait for NHOS final decision
- **Now - August 14**: Wait for CEO response
- **ASAP**: Complete house sale/purchase
- **After August 14**: File new NHOS complaint from new home
- **Future**: When second complaint wins, threaten to go public
