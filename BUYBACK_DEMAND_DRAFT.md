# Buyback Demand - Plot 34/10 Colt View

**To:** Martyn Clark, CEO, Crest Nicholson  
**CC:** Mark Foyle, Group Managing Director; Charlie Joseph, Regional Managing Director  
**Subject:** Buyback Demand - Criminal Building Regulations Breach & NHBC Dual Role Failure

Dear Mr. Clark,

## The Situation

Following recent confirmations from NHBC and Winchester Building Control, the catastrophic nature of Plot 34's construction failures has become undeniable:

1. **NHBC has confirmed** our property should have been built to 2022/2023 standards
2. **You have admitted** to NHOS that 2014 standards were used - 8-9 years out of date
3. **Winchester Building Control has confirmed** NHBC acted as Building Control for this development
4. **NHBC therefore failed** in BOTH their statutory duty (Building Control) AND commercial duty (warranty provider)

## The Implications

This creates potential criminal liability under Section 35 of the Building Act 1984 for:
- Crest Nicholson (building to wrong standards)
- NHBC (approving as Building Control)
- Individual directors and officers

The property is now effectively unsaleable. No reasonable buyer would purchase knowing:
- Built to obsolete standards with unknown compliance issues
- Building Control approval was compromised by conflict of interest
- Warranty based on failed dual-role inspections
- Criminal proceedings may follow

## The Precedent

You have previously purchased 25 Abbots Road from us to resolve construction issues. This situation is far more serious, involving:
- Criminal liability exposure
- Systematic use of outdated standards
- Regulatory body failure
- Unknown defects from 9 years of ignored updates

## The Demand

**Purchase Plot 34/10 Colt View within 60 days at full market value** - defined as the value if properly built to correct standards.

**Current market valuations**: [To be inserted following estate agent assessments]  
**Buyback price**: [Highest valuation + 5%]

This includes:
- Vacant possession within 60 days
- All reasonable moving costs
- No new NDAs or confidentiality clauses
- Clean break with no ongoing liability

## The Alternative

If this offer is not accepted within 7 days, I will:

1. **File criminal complaint** with Building Control regarding Section 35 breaches
2. **Report to Building Safety Regulator** regarding NHBC's dual role conflict
3. **Brief construction media** about the use of 2014 standards in 2022/2023
4. **Contact institutional shareholders** about director criminal liability exposure
5. **Coordinate with other Plot 34 owners** who likely face identical issues
6. **Provide evidence to mortgage lenders** about systemic defects

## The Evidence

I have documented evidence of:
- Your admission to NHOS about using 2014 standards
- NHBC's confirmation that 2022/2023 standards should have been used
- Winchester's confirmation of NHBC's dual role
- Multiple defects NHBC missed in both roles:
  - Movement joints (required by even 2014 standards)
  - Air brick burial (I found, not NHBC)
  - DPC violations (Trinity Rose found, not NHBC)
  - Open soil vent pipe (Trinity Rose found, not NHBC)
  - Roof void gaps with infestation (Trinity Rose found, not NHBC)

## The Resolution

A clean buyback resolves this for all parties:
- Removes your criminal liability exposure
- Prevents media scandal about obsolete standards
- Avoids investigation into NHBC relationship
- Contains the problem to one property
- Provides precedent consistent with 25 Abbots Road

## Time Limit

Given the serious nature of criminal liability and the approaching 2-year warranty expiry (December 18, 2025), this matter requires urgent resolution.

I await your response by [date - 7 days from sending].

Yours sincerely,

Paul Robert Taylor

- NHBC email confirming 2022/2023 standards requirement
- Your NHOS submission admitting 2014 standards use
- Winchester Building Control confirmation of NHBC's role
- Trinity Rose Construction Assessment
- MJA Consulting structural report
- Estate agent valuations [to follow]

**Note**: This buyback demand is made without prejudice to any criminal or civil claims that may arise from the use of obsolete building standards and the failure of building control oversight.
