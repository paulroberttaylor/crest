We\r\nare still waiting for the wardrobe company to visit. Please could you\r\nconfirm what is happening with this.\r\n\r\nI am still waiting for feedback on the state the bricks were left after the\r\nNHBC asked to have them removed (at the side of the house to the drive). I\r\ncan show before and after photos. I have chased this several times.\r\n\r\nRegarding the DPC, I am also still waiting for the evidence, the documents\r\nthat your build manager said he used to check this. The brickwork is not\r\nwithin NHBC tolerances, and our contract quite clearly states that anything\r\nnot to NHBC tolerance will be rectified.\r\n\r\nI would like a copy of the documentation your build manager referenced, and\r\nalso a copy of the communication from the NHBC confirming that it is within\r\ntolerance and does not need to be touched.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n",

I am requesting this final response so that\r\nthe NHBC can officially become involved in resolving this matter. The NHBC\r\nhas instructed me to seek a final response from you before they can proceed\r\nwith their involvement.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the inadequate DPC was previously brought to your attention\r\npreviously. The DPC located at the brick wall between garage doors does not\r\nmeet the NHBC minimum tolerances as required by the NHBC Buildmark policy\r\nand Technical Requirements.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to draw your attention to a specific clause in the\r\nproperty contract provided by Crest Nicholson South. This clause, which was\r\nincluded by your company, explicitly states that any tolerances that are\r\nnot met must be addressed as a contractual obligation. I would be grateful\r\nif you could also explain why you are choosing to breach this clause.\r\n\r\nIn previous correspondence, you stated that you have documentation\r\nverifying that there is no issue with the DPC. As this documentation is\r\ncrucial to resolving this matter, I formally request that you provide a\r\ncopy of this documentation within the next 7 days. If you are unable to\r\nprovide this documentation, please confirm in writing that no such\r\ndocumentation exists. This confirmation should be included in your final\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nIn light of both the NHBC requirements and your own contractual commitment,\r\nI kindly request that you provide me with a clear outline of your\r\nintentions to rectify this problem, including a reasonable timeframe for\r\nthe necessary repairs, to bring the DPC up to the required standards.\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me with a final decision letter addressing the\r\ninadequate DPC issue within 30 days of receiving this letter.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this letter specifically addresses the DPC tolerance\r\ni",

They are however not going to provide it. Their logic is that we\r\nwanted to exchange and complete as soon as possible, which has no relevance\r\nto the certification, but is somehow being used to justify ignoring the\r\nlegal contract.\r\n\r\nThey also claim that the work was done according to the satisfaction of the\r\nsurveyor but can't prove it, since the final certification was never given.\r\n\r\nIt was a requirement as part of the contract for 10 Colt View, and I do not\r\nunderstand why they feel they can pick and choose what they will abide by\r\nand what they will not.\r\n\r\nThey are also, despite it being listed in the reservation agreement,\r\nrefusing to put a second instance of incorrect DPC right, claiming that the\r\nNHBC standards are only guidelines.  A guideline does not state a minimum\r\nmeasurement for tolerances.  DPC tolerances are a part of the NHBC's\r\ntechnical standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Contract for 10 Colt View*\r\n\r\n1.14.2. The Seller has undertaken these works (if any) and, if appropriate,\r\n> the surveyor has certified that these works (if any) have been\r\n> satisfactorily completed.\r\n\r\n1.16.6. Any damage or defects which fall within NHBC tolerances.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Reservation Agreement:*\r\n\r\n19. Key principles surrounding the structural survey by Trinity Rose:\r\n> a.

The *surveyor will certify once all the required works have been\r\n> satisfactorily completed*.

His initial findings are deeply concerning and dramatically alter\r\nthe understanding of the defects:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - *Not Settlement: *Within moments of inspecting the primary cracked\r\n   wall, the surveyor stated unequivocally that the issue is not due to\r\n   settlement.\r\n   - *Probable Design/Construction Flaw:* His professional opinion is that\r\n   the affected wall is likely too long and was constructed without a\r\n   necessary compression joint. He indicated such a joint will now need to be\r\n   installed, likely mid-wall, which will inevitably have a significant and\r\n   negative aesthetic impact on a new property, an unacceptable outcome for a\r\n   home of this age and supposed quality.\r\n   - *Discovery of Further Cracks: *The surveyor also identified additional\r\n   cracks on other external walls of the property, suggesting the issue may be\r\n   more widespread than initially reported and not confined to one area.\r\n   - *Anticipated Disruption & Mitigation: *Due to the extensive work\r\n   (chipping off all render from all walls, and now the potential installation\r\n   of a compression joint), the surveyor has already indicated he will be\r\n   recommending that Crest Nicholson provide me with temporary office space\r\n   for the duration of the works due to the inevitable extreme noise and\r\n   disruption.\r\n   - *Request for Specifications & Potential Delays: *The surveyor requires\r\n   the original build specifications for this house type from Crest Nicholson\r\n   to confirm the design requirements regarding compre",

We will arrange for the scaffold to be struck once this has been undertaken. The scaffold will be struck as soon as both parties have confirmed they are satisfied with the works.\r\n\r\nWe have been advised by Gen Drywall that you have confirmed with their operative you are happy.  Could you please confirm if this is the case?\r\n\r\nI will postpone my visit planned for Tuesday 5th November until after the scaffold is removed to carry out the inspection of the exterior areas.\r\n\r\nI have provisionally booked the cleaners for Thursday 7th November 2024.

They are however not going to provide it. Their logic is that we\r\nwanted to exchange and complete as soon as possible, which has no relevance\r\nto the certification, but is somehow being used to justify ignoring the\r\nlegal contract.\r\n\r\nThey also claim that the work was done according to the satisfaction of the\r\nsurveyor but can't prove it, since the final certification was never given.\r\n\r\nIt was a requirement as part of the contract for 10 Colt View, and I do not\r\nunderstand why they feel they can pick and choose what they will abide by\r\nand what they will not.\r\n\r\nThey are also, despite it being listed in the reservation agreement,\r\nrefusing to put a second instance of incorrect DPC right, claiming that the\r\nNHBC standards are only guidelines.  A guideline does not state a minimum\r\nmeasurement for tolerances.  DPC tolerances are a part of the NHBC's\r\ntechnical standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Contract for 10 Colt View*\r\n\r\n1.14.2. The Seller has undertaken these works (if any) and, if appropriate,\r\n> the surveyor has certified that these works (if any) have been\r\n> satisfactorily completed.\r\n\r\n1.16.6. Any damage or defects which fall within NHBC tolerances.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Reservation Agreement:*\r\n\r\n19. Key principles surrounding the structural survey by Trinity Rose:\r\n> a. Following exchange of contracts and prior to completion of the Property\r\n> the Seller and Buyer will jointly instruct Trinity Rose (or other agreed\r\n> accredited RICS surveyor) to undertake a structural\r\n> survey of the Property (paid for by the Seller) in order to identify *any non-compliance\r\n> with NHBC technical standards* or Building Regulations.\r\n> e.

I am requesting this final response so that\r\nthe NHBC can officially become involved in resolving this matter. The NHBC\r\nhas instructed me to seek a final response from you before they can proceed\r\nwith their involvement.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the inadequate DPC was previously brought to your attention\r\npreviously. The DPC located at the brick wall between garage doors does not\r\nmeet the NHBC minimum tolerances as required by the NHBC Buildmark policy\r\nand Technical Requirements.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to draw your attention to a specific clause in the\r\nproperty contract provided by Crest Nicholson South. This clause, which was\r\nincluded by your company, explicitly states that any tolerances that are\r\nnot met must be addressed as a contractual obligation. I would be grateful\r\nif you could also explain why you are choosing to breach this clause.\r\n\r\nIn previous correspondence, you stated that you have documentation\r\nverifying that there is no issue with the DPC. As this documentation is\r\ncrucial to resolving this matter, I formally request that you provide a\r\ncopy of this documentation within the next 7 days. If you are unable to\r\nprovide this documentation, please confirm in writing that no such\r\ndocumentation exists. This confirmation should be included in your final\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nIn light of both the NHBC requirements and your own contractual commitment,\r\nI kindly request that you provide me with a clear outline of your\r\nintentions to rectify this problem, including a reasonable timeframe for\r\nthe necessary repairs, to bring the DPC up to the required standards.\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me with a final decision letter addressing the\r\ninadequate DPC issue within 30 days of receiving this letter.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this letter specifically addresses the DPC tolerance\r\ni",

Additionally, I was expecting a\r\nreply early this week concerning the matter as a whole, but it is now\r\nmidweek with no further communication.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate confirmation of an actual date by which the full\r\nresponse will be provided. However, I do need the inspection report and the\r\ndecision on the NDA permission today.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMr. Taylor\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\r\nDate: Tue, 19 Nov 2024, 11:06\r\nSubject: Fwd: FW: [EXTERNAL] Fwd: 0034 Albany Wood\r\nTo: Beth Marioni <Beth.Marioni@crestnicholson.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Ms. Marioni,\r\n\r\nI am writing to follow up on the email yesterday on two specific requests\r\nthat can be addressed independently of Mr. Clark\u2019s full response:\r\n\r\n1. Inspection Report: I am still waiting for a copy of the inspection\r\nreport prepared by the staff member who visited my property. Please could I\r\nhave this today.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. NDA Consent: I would appreciate confirmation regarding Crest\u2019s position\r\non granting permission to discuss the 25 Abbots Road NDA in relation to my\r\ncurrent situation. The NDA states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr and Mrs Taylor confirm and agree that they shall not disclose terms of\r\nthis Memorandum of Agreement, nor the substance of all negotiations in\r\nconnection with it, or otherwise communicate them, to any third party\r\n(without the written consent of Crest Nicholson, such consent not to be\r\nunreasonably withheld) other than to their professional advisors on terms\r\nwhich preserve confidentiality or to the extent as may be required by law).\"\r\n\r\nGiven this clause, I trust that any decision to withhold consent would not\r\nbe made unreasonably, and a valid reason given that can be given to the\r\nNHOS.\r\n\r\nThese matters are straightforward and can be resolved without delaying Mr.\r\nClark\u2019s comprehe",
        "Subject: RE: Access to Bridal Path - Crest Nicholson\nFrom: Sharnie Evans <sharnie.evans@nhos.org.uk>\nTo: \"paulroberttaylor@gmail.com\" <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>\nDate: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 15:24:41 +0000\nGood afternoon Paul,\r\n\r\nThank you for your email.\r\n\r\nIf the bridal path access forms a requirement under the S106 agreement then there would be an obligation as part of their planning consent to fulfil this. It would form part of a condition for their planning permission that they would need formally discharge (i.e: prove they have implemented it) with the local planning authority. The exact legalities of this we would not be able to advise upon, however, as we are not a legal advice service. You would need to run this past an independent legal advisor for further information.\r\n\r\nUnless you have formally raised this as a complaint with the developer and completed their complaints process it is also not something we would be able to consider with an ongoing complaint. You would either need to put this on hold until you meet our eligibility requirements; or you would need to raise this as a separate complaint at a later date.\r\n\r\nI trust this clarifies matters for you and would recommend, as above, seeking some legal advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nSharnie Evans\r\nCaseworker | New Homes Ombudsman Service | www.nhos.org.uk<http://www.nhos.org.uk/>\r\nE:  sharnie.evans@nhos.org.uk<mailto:sharnie.evans@nhos.org.uk>\r\nMain number: 0330 808 4286\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------- Forwarded Message ---------------\r\nFrom: Paul Taylor [paulroberttaylor@gmail.com]\r\nSent: 14/10/2024 14:10\r\nTo: customer.services@nhos.org.uk<mailto:customer.services@nhos.org.uk>\r\nSubject: Access to Bridal Path - Crest Nicholson\r\n\r\nGood morning,\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if you could advise. As part of the selling process, Crest Nicholson advised that access to the local bridal path would be created.\r\n\r\nI have been chasing this for 10 months and still nothing.\r\n\r\nThe local parish council has let me know that Crest is claiming that there is an alternative in place, which does not give anything remotely like the same access, but they are legally obliged (under the S106 Agreement) to create the original access.\r\n\r\nThis "
