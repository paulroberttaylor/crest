## Key Violations of New Homes Quality Code

### 1. Part 2.5 - Realistic Completion Dates
**Violation**: 5-6 month delay from original promise
- **Original Promise**: June/July 2023 (site manager during viewing)
- **First Delay**: Pushed to September/October 2023 (May 18, 2023)
- **Second Delay**: October 31, 2023 target failed
- **Actual Completion**: December 18, 2023
- **Total Delay**: 5-6 months

**Key Evidence**:
- May 18, 2023: Paul questions why "building team were confident it would be ready in June or July"
- October 24, 2023: Solicitor confirms "not ready" just 7 days before completion

### 2. Part 3.1 - Quality of Home at Handover
**Violation**: 45 defects identified on completion day
- **Date**: January 4, 2024
- **Document**: Lynn Carrington's Pro Snag List
- **Major Issues Include**:
  - Water damage to dishwasher door
  - Tapping noise in mega flow
  - Settlement cracks in multiple rooms
  - Garage DPC and water leakage
  - Guttering full of debris
  - Multiple door, window, and wardrobe issues

### 3. Principle 1 - Fairness (Misrepresentation)
**Multiple False Claims**:
1. **Build Manager's "15 Checks" Lie**
   - Claimed to have checked property 15 times plus Stage 12 inspection
   - Missed: Buried air brick, inadequate DPC, uncleaned gutters, 45 defects
   - Admitted Paul "knew more about NHBC standards" than him

2. **Gutter Cleaning Lie**
   - October 4, 2023: Paul asks if gutters cleaned
   - Natalie Haigh confirms they were
   - January 17, 2024: Drone photos and plumber prove this was false

3. **DPC Denial**
   - Trinity Rose confirmed garage DPC "less than half NHBC's minimum"
   - Crest claimed garages don't need proper DPC
   - Never provided promised documentation to support claim

### 4. Principle 5 - Responsiveness
**Pattern of Poor Communication**:
- **"URGENT: 10 Colt View" Thread Statistics**:
  - 36 total emails (December 5-13, 2023)
  - Paul sent: 25 emails (69%)
  - Crest responses: 10 emails (28%)
  - Ratio: 2.5 emails required for each response

### 5. Part 2.2 - Delays and Compensation
**Financial Impact**:
- £7,552.20 extra mortgage costs due to rate rises during delays
- £6,000 reduced borrowing capacity
- Multiple removal bookings cancelled/rescheduled
- Mortgage nearly expired

**Key Evidence**:
- June 6, 2023: Paul warns about rate rises affecting mortgage
- November 1, 2023: Mortgage expiry threats begin
- December 13, 2023: Solicitor states "we think they are doing this deliberately so that our mortgage expires"

## Critical Evidence Points

### 1. The October 25 vs 31 Dispute
- Paul requested October 25 (his only available date)
- Crest said "not achievable"
- Only 4 working days difference to October 31
- Clear evidence Crest prioritized "end of year targets"

### 2. Trinity Rose Payment Fiasco
- Crest agreed to pay £1,300 for survey
- Failed to confirm payment to Trinity Rose
- Survey delayed from October 11
- Report never properly provided
- Defeated the entire purpose of the survey

### 3. Contract Documentation Failures
- Contract described as "vastly different from standard"
- Updated contract not provided for 7+ months
- October 24: Still missing with 7 days to go
- November 27: Still waiting after October failure
- December 18: Still finalizing on completion day

### 4. Completion Day Disaster
- December 18, 2023 Timeline:
  - 1:50 PM: Paul arrives with removal van
  - 2:28 PM: "Unable to release keys until legal completion"
  - 2:31 PM: Only garage access granted
  - 4:27 PM: Finally "Funds released, key release instructed"
  - **2.5+ hours waiting outside with removal van**

### 5. Safety Issues Missed
- **Air Brick Burial**: Paul found air brick half-buried under driveway
- **DPC Issues**: Garage DPC only 100mm (should be 150mm minimum)
- **Both violations of NHBC standards**
- **Paul had to identify these himself**

## Pattern of Behavior

1. **Make unrealistic promises** (June/July completion)
2. **Fail to provide documentation** (7+ months for contract)
3. **Create artificial obstacles** (Trinity Rose payment)
4. **Prioritize corporate targets** (October 31 over October 25)
5. **Misrepresent property condition** (15 checks claim)
6. **Leave everything to last minute** (December completion chaos)
7. **Require constant chasing** (2.5:1 email ratio)

## Conclusion

The evidence demonstrates systematic failures by Crest Nicholson in their treatment of Paul and Jade Taylor during the purchase process.
