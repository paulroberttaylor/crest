# Formal Complaint: Treatment During Purchase of Plot 34/10 Colt View

**To:** Martyn Clark, CEO  
**CC:** Mark Foyle, Group Managing Director; Charlie Joseph, Regional Managing Director  
**From:** Paul Robert Taylor  
**Date:** [DATE]  
**Subject:** Formal Complaint - Purchase Treatment Violations

Dear Mr. Clark,

I am writing to formally complain about Crest Nicholson's treatment of my family during the purchase and handover of Plot 34 (10 Colt View) between June 2023 and January 2024.

This complaint is separate from my ongoing NHOS case regarding render defects (NHOS-2024-000512) and NHBC claim regarding movement joints. It concerns the systematic failures, misrepresentations, and financial harm we suffered during the purchase process.

## Immediate Demands

Before detailing my complaint, I require:

1. **Independent third-party surveyor** to verify ALL Trinity Rose findings were properly remediated - paid for by Crest Nicholson within 30 days
2. **Compensation of £8,136.87** for quantifiable financial losses
3. **Written acknowledgment and apology** within 14 days

## Summary of Violations

### Safety Violations (Principle 2)

Your company handed over a property with serious safety hazards that your build manager's "15 checks" and Stage 12 inspection failed to identify:

- **Garage DPC at only 70mm** - less than half the NHBC requirement of 150mm
- **Open soil vent pipe in loft** - creating sewer gas risk
- **Unsealed roof void** - allowing vermin access (fly infestation found)
- **Air brick buried under driveway** - I had to identify this critical ventilation issue myself
  - When confronted, Donna Hack had the audacity to say "Well, we fixed it didn't we?"
  - No acknowledgment that YOUR inspectors failed to spot this basic safety violation

Trinity Rose (Oliver Culhane, MRICS) documented these violations in October 2023. You forced us to pay for this survey, then refused to fund verification that remedial works were completed. We still don't know if these safety issues were properly addressed.

### Quality Failures (Principle 3)

Despite your build manager claiming "approximately 15 checks" plus a Stage 12 inspection:

- **45 defects identified on completion day** (January 4, 2024)
- Widespread finishing defects beyond NHBC tolerances
- Water damage, settlement cracks, guttering full of debris
- Property not fit for habitation as promised

The same build manager admitted to me that I "probably know more about NHBC standards than himself."

### Fairness - Proven Lies (Principle 1)

Your staff made multiple false claims:

1. **Gutter Cleaning Lie**: When I specifically asked "Has the guttering been cleared and cleaned?", Natalie Haigh PROMISED "Yes, this has been done" (October 4, 2023). Drone photography and independent plumber proved this was a direct lie.

2. **Inspection Claims**: "15 checks" that missed 45 defects plus critical safety issues

3. **DPC Standards**: Lynn Carrington claimed garages don't need proper DPC but never provided promised documentation

### Responsiveness Failures (Principle 5)

Analysis of our correspondence reveals:
- **2.5:1 email ratio** - I sent 25 emails to receive 10 responses
- **42 documented instances** of having to chase for responses
- **One delay of 163 days** for a response
- **"URGENT: 10 Colt View" thread**: 36 emails over 8 days in December 2023

### Completion Date Failures (Part 2.5)

- **Original promise**: June/July 2023
- **Actual completion**: December 18, 2023
- **Total delay**: 5-6 months

The October 25 vs 31 dispute exemplifies your priorities - you refused my only available date (October 25) but insisted on October 31 for "end of year targets" despite only 4 working days difference.

### Quality at Handover (Part 3.1)

On December 18, 2023, my family was subjected to the humiliation of:
- Standing outside our new home for **2.5+ hours** with a removal van
- Being refused entry from 1:50 PM until 4:27 PM
- Legal completion not processed despite being scheduled completion day
- Removal crew standing idle incurring hourly charges

## Financial Harm

Your delays and failures caused quantifiable losses:

**Mortgage impact**: £8,136.87 in additional interest over 5-year term
- Lost favorable rate of 4.38% (February 2023)
- Forced to accept 4.72% due to your delays
- Monthly payment increased by £94.82

Additionally, your delays caused us to lose two removal companies and incur premium rebooking costs during the Christmas period, though these were covered in our previous agreement.

## The Trinity Rose Scandal

Most damning is your handling of the Trinity Rose survey:
1. You forced us to commission it
2. It found serious NHBC violations
3. You claimed to fix the issues
4. **You refused to fund verification**

This means we have no proof that:
- The garage DPC was raised to 150mm
- The soil vent pipe was properly connected
- The roof void was sealed against vermin
- Any of the defects were properly fixed

## Required Actions

With my 2-year warranty expiring December 18, 2025, I require immediate action:

1. **Third-party surveyor verification** within 30 days at your expense
2. **Full compensation** of £8,136.87
3. **Written acknowledgment** of all failures detailed above
4. **Formal apology** without NDA restrictions

## Next Steps

This is a formal complaint under your complaints procedure. I am aware that after 56 days, I may escalate to the New Homes Ombudsman Service.

Given your company's:
- Current financial vulnerability (£9.4m profit for H1 2025)
- History of misrepresenting facts to NHOS (as per my render complaint)
- Pattern of customer mistreatment

I trust you will treat this complaint with the seriousness it deserves.

I require a substantive response within 14 days. Failure to respond appropriately will result in:
1. Immediate preparation of NHOS complaint
2. Contact with institutional shareholders
3. Public documentation of these failures

I await your response.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Robert Taylor
