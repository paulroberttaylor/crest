## 3. Render Defects (MJA Consulting Report - June 19, 2025)

### Structural Engineer Assessment
- **Engineer**: R.Flanagan BEng CEng MIStructE
- **Reference**: RF/RP/0528/6398

### Confirmed Render Cracks:
1. **Western gable elevation crack**: 
   - Located halfway along elevation in upper render
   - Repaired twice but failed both times
2. **Front elevation crack**: 
   - Vertical crack from cast cill to ensuite
   - Runs to lead flashing of porch roof
3. **Eastern gable elevation crack**: 
   - Located at junction of eaves

### Root Causes Identified:
- Blockwork shrinkage/movement
- **Lack of movement joints** (critical finding)
- Possible lack of bedjoint reinforcement
- Possible use of green blocks during construction

### Critical Finding:
"Cracking to the render may accelerate the degradation of the finish and lead to an early failure of the render"

## 4. Safety Violations Identified by Paul Taylor

### Air Brick Burial (July 6, 2023)
- **Issue**: Air brick "half buried on the drive"
- **NHBC Standard**: Air bricks must not be blocked by soil or paving
- **Risk**: Serious damp and ventilation problems
- **Significance**: Paul had to identify this himself despite "15 checks"

### Additional DPC Issue at Garage Front
- **December 14, 2023**: "The DPC at the garage dividing the two doors should be a minimum of 150mm, not one brick and a part of a brick"
- **January 5, 2024**: Build manager claimed 100mm was acceptable (false)

---

## 5. Specific Issues Requiring Major Remediation

### ACO Drain Installation (November 28-29, 2023)
- **Issue**: DPC violation at rear of garage so serious that:
  - Entire rear path had to be lifted
  - ACO drain system installed
  - Major remedial work required
- **Site manager confirmed**: "aco run is solid with no perforation"

### Water Ingress in Garage
- **February 20, 2024**: Paul reports ongoing water ingress
- **March 20, 2024**: Crest dismisses as "not a defect"
- **Pattern**: Multiple reports of water entering garage

- **Oliver Culhane (MRICS)**: Trinity Rose surveyor
- **R.Flanagan (MJA)**: Structural engineer confirming render issues
- **Build Manager**: Claimed 15 checks, admitted knowing less than Paul about NHBC
