# Welcome to r/CrestNicholsonReviews - NHOS Rules Against Crest Nicholson

Hi everyone,

I've created this subreddit after experiencing firsthand how Crest Nicholson handles customer complaints. After 500+ days, the New Homes Ombudsman Service (NHOS) is reviewing my case where Crest:

1. **Dismissed structural defects as "cosmetic" for 18 months**
2. **Misrepresented their own expert's report to NHOS**
3. **Proposed a "goodwill" fix they knew would fail**

## The Evidence

Their own structural engineer (MJA Consulting) found:
- Render cracking caused by **blockwork movement** 
- Would lead to **"early failure of the render"**
- Requires **movement joints cut into the structure**

Yet Crest told NHOS it was "superficial" with "no long-term impact" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Why This Matters

- Crest Nicholson warned of potential **loan covenant breach by April 2025**
- Share price dropped 5.5% on the news
- They need sales but are treating buyers terribly
