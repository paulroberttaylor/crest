# NHBC "Sign Off" Claims - Critical Evidence

## Summary
Crest Nicholson made specific claims that NHBC "signed off" the property, which NHBC has now contradicted by stating they "do not 'sign off' homes as defect free".

## Evidence of Crest's Claims

### 1. Natalie Haigh - September 28, 2023 at 4:28 PM

**Email Details:**
- **Date:** September 28, 2023 at 4:28 PM
- **From:** Natalie Haigh <Natalie.Haigh@crestnicholson.com>
- **To:** Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>, Jade Taylor <jade.millington@hotmail.co.uk>
- **CC:** Serhan Handani <sh@bramsdonandchilds.com>, Hannah Rafferty <hr@bramsdonandchilds.com>, Danielle Green <Danielle.Green@crestnicholson.com>, Steve Smith <Steve.Smith@crestnicholson.com>
- **Subject:** Plot 34 Albany Road

**EXACT QUOTE:**
> "I thought I would let you know we are aiming to achieve CML this week. (NHBC sign off) We would like to invite you to visit your property from Monday 9th October."

**Key Points:**
- Natalie Haigh explicitly equated "CML" with "NHBC sign off" in parentheses
- This was communicated to both purchasers and their legal representatives
- Used as indication property was ready for completion

### 2. Lynn Carrington - January 25, 2024 at 10:53 AM

**Email Details:**
- **Date:** January 25, 2024 at 10:53 AM
- **From:** Lynn Carrington <Lynn.Carrington@crestnicholson.com>
- **To:** Paul Taylor <paulroberttaylor@gmail.com>
- **CC:** Indy Dhaliwal <Indy.Dhaliwal@crestnicholson.com>, Customer Service SO <CustomerServiceSO@crestnicholson.com>, Mark Collins <Mark.Collins@crestnicholson.com>
- **Subject:** RE: [EXTERNAL] Re: Plot 34 Albany Wood Defects

**EXACT QUOTE:**
> "The NHBC have approved our standard drawings and signed off the property and issued a CML. Their opinion is that 75mm is sufficient and is generally accepted, as the splash zone is reduced, as the length of the wall in question is minimal and it wouldn't cause a major concern."

**Key Points:**
- Claims NHBC "signed off the property"
- Claims NHBC approved non-compliant DPC height (75mm vs required 150mm)
- Suggests NHBC endorsed the violation as "sufficient"
- Used to justify refusal to remedy defect

## Critical Contradiction

**NHBC's Official Position:**
NHBC has now stated they "do not 'sign off' homes as defect free".

This directly contradicts Crest's representations that:
1. NHBC provides a "sign off" that validates construction quality
2. NHBC approval means defects are acceptable
3. NHBC's "sign off" justifies non-compliance with their own standards

## Implications

1. **Misrepresentation:** Crest misrepresented NHBC's role and authority to purchasers
2. **False Justification:** Used non-existent "NHBC sign off" to refuse remediation
3. **Pattern of Deception:** Multiple staff members made similar false claims
4. **Consumer Protection Violation:** Misleading purchasers about regulatory approvals

## Timeline of Claims

- **September 28, 2023:** First claim of "NHBC sign off" to induce completion
- **January 25, 2024:** Second claim used to justify defect (after completion)
- **July 2025:** NHBC clarifies they don't provide such "sign offs"

## Recommendation

This evidence should be:
1. Submitted to NHBC for investigation
2. Included in NHOS complaint as evidence of misrepresentation
3. Forwarded to Trading Standards
4. Used in any legal proceedings

The pattern shows systematic misrepresentation of NHBC's role to both induce completion and avoid remediation responsibilities.
