The exact legalities of this we would not be able to advise upon, however, as we are not a legal advice service. Yo...

Dear Mr Taylor

Thank you very much for the helpful feedback below, as I said when you first contacted me, I have recently joined the New Homes Ombudsman Service and it’s incredibly useful for me to have information from customers on their views of the service. We have a lot of feedback we can tap into from developers as they are regular users, but customer insight is less common, so it’s very much appreciated.

Dear Paul

I have just had a quick discussion with James, he had meant to write requesting information in relation to the public path issue – that is where we do not have clarity on when the complaint was raised with Crest Nicholson. I agree with you that the issue / dates in relation to the render complaint are clear.

In relation to the path, given the timing already, if we take it as November when you raised it then the 8 weeks are pretty close to being complete which means it will fall w...

Dear Paul

You complaint is in the casework stage, with James conducting the investigation. The approach we are required to take as an ombudsman service, does mean that both parties get the opportunity to provide submissions throughout a case journey – when there is new information or a change proposed. Once we have the information back from Crest, unless they are offering a proposal to your satisfaction then it will likely move to an ombudsman for them to make a formal decision – which could ...

Good Morning,

Thanks for your email.

As each complaint is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, the ombudsman may require reaching out to either or both parties for further information, which could mean a case potentially being placed on hold.

Although we understand that extensions of time may be frustrating for some parties because they are anxious to make progress or to draw a case to a close, the Ombudsman aims to reach the right conclusion based on the information available to them an...

Good afternoon



I am writing from the New Homes Ombudsman Service to ask whether you would be interested in taking part in some research to gather people’s views on new-build homes, particularly from anyone who has had a problem with their developer and has raised a complaint.

Dear Mr Taylor

That means that complaints are investigated under our inquisitorial remit and to our timetable, both of which are applied in order to ensure disputes are resolved fairly and effectively.

Where a complaint has not been able to be resolved through early resolution or mediation, and it goes to an ombudsman for decision, it is for the individual ombu...
