In response to your email below, with the original request being sent 3 working days ago, we can respond as follows.

Information on practical issues that arise during the construction process is not something we provide to purchasers.    If the NHBC warranty provider and building control do raise any issues during the construction phase these are actioned prior to completion so that the NHBC can provide the warranty to enable (as with your property) legal completion to take place.

I will log the front door for the carpenter to arrange with you an appointment, and once you have confirmed the which utility door, if external this would be for Munster...

Good afternoon Mr Taylor,

Munster arrange their own diary and will have provided you with their first available date to visit to inspect.

Although we can appreciate that having a small draft through the bottom of the doors is not preferable, we do not deem this to be an emergency that requires urgent attention.

To mitigate the effect of the draft, we would suggest you utilise a form of draft exclusion prior to their visit.

regards

Thank you Mr Taylor

You will be provided with feedback this week as promised following the subcontractorâ€™s visit. I am unable to make the dates you have proposed and the earliest following available for me is the 17th November. We will also await your own contractorâ€™s assessment / quotations as discussed at our previous meeting. In obtaining these we can look to have a productive and perhaps conclusive meeting on the 17th or another mutually agreeable date?

Good morning Mr Taylor,

As previously advised and detailed by Calford Seadon in their report, these are minor marks to external timber and do not require any action from Crest.

We have advised we will review and carry out sanding if necessary, but this is not something for the fencer to action

Dear Mr Taylor

I hope you are well and settling into your new home.

The mortgage broker fee query was raised the day of legal completion, following the completion statement being agreed.

It was communicated via our solicitors and before completion this fee did not form part of our agreement, therefore any cost associated to this, was not the responsibility of Crest Nicholson.


Kind regards
Eileen Guihen

Good afternoon Mr Taylor

I am on another development today.

I have spoken to my colleague Steve, and he will drop in with the oven racks.  Just for your information, the ovens only come with 1 rack and the grill pan.  This is the specification of the ovens.

Dear Mr Taylor

The specification for the appliance specifies that x1 oven rack is provided. However, our sales team will drop an additional oven rack to you shortly, I appreciate the inconvenience of trying to source another one this close to Christmas will cause.

We will investigate the enquires below when the office reopens after the Christmas break.

Good evening, Mr Taylor

I attach a copy of the survey results from our inspection of the garden at your property.

This has been produced by way of an overlay drawing from which you can see the various spot levels shown in red figures.  In overall terms there are some variations in gradient across your garden, but all sit comfortably within the NHBC requirements for gradient levels.

In these circumstances we do not consider that any additional steps need to be taken by us with respect ga...

Good afternoon, Mr Taylor,

Thank you for your email and I am sorry if you were expecting something different to what has been provided. In answer to your concerns raised in your email of 6.34pm, Thursday 5th April.

The survey provided by Trinity Rose had three main issues:

  1.  There were not enough levels taken to accurately assess the as-built gradient and construction of the garden.
  2.  Measurements were not given on the survey and no scale was provided â€“ we therefore could not a...

Good afternoon, Mr Taylor

We have requested on several occasions dates for the blown tapes to be inspected by a contractor, the inspection would determine how much time works is required and the time to be provided to complete the works.  Due to no response, we are now closing this down on our system.

If you do want to have the works completed, please do get In touch where we will be happy to arrange the works.

Kind Regards

The render works will take approximately two weeks from removing to applying the new, and scaffolding to be erected the week before, following the works, removal of scaffolding, cleaning, and landscaping ...
