Good morning Paul,

Thank you for your email.

I will be booking your Home Demo for approximately 5 to 7 days prior to completion.

The cable you have seen, as you requested, is 40 amp rated and will be terminated in a small box, ready for a future charger unit.

As previously discussed at reservation, there is no shower over the bath. The standard fit is a handset.

I am not sure where your information comes from regarding Silestone in Utility rooms. None of our houses have this and w...

The upgraded shower is not thermostatic as in the en-suite. It is just an extended hose, with a screen, which you could easily do after completion. It is now too late too request this, which would have cost £450. There were no other upgrades available to you.

Jade & Paul

We had a meeting with the groundworker and he is proposing a plan for the paving so we will let you know once I have a date from them.

Window cleaning has been booked for the 14th February and Munster will attend on the 15th February. Munster will let me know a time on the day.

I have asked Naio for a professional comment on the turf and he has also ordered your plants for you.

Good afternoon Mr Taylor,

Further to your email to our Chief Executive and my subsequent acknowledgement below, I have discussed the content of your complaint with our team and it would appear there are a number of areas of dispute.
For me to fully understand the issues highlighted and how we can move forward to bring matters to a conclusion, I think it may be prudent to meet with you at your home to discuss.

The silo is now fixed and they will be back tomorrow. Scott did go round this morning to explain but got no answer.

Baram are on site and attending your property today. The landscaper will be attending your plot once the work is complete. Due to the bad weather yesterday this has put us back a day so it will be unlikely that this will be complete this week. Baram will make sure the garden is left in a clean and tidy state and I will inspect on Friday. Baram will be carrying out the soil works and Naio will be carrying out the turfing once the ground is prepared.

Good afternoon,

Our independent Chartered Survey is carrying out a full review but not all areas require measurements being taken as a visual view is sometimes all that is required, as per your own surveyors report. Should she believe a further visit to take actual plumb measurements is required this will be undertaken.

Good afternoon Mr Taylor,

Further to your email concerning the dead plants to the front of your property, this is not something that Crest will be addressing.
The plants would have needed high extent of watering during what has been an unprecedented year for extreme heat and this is the homeowner responsibility.

Although there is concrete haunching within the ground, which is installed to every pavement edge, this would not have stopped the plants from growing with pavement in place.

Although there is haunching to the side of the pavement, there is plenty of room for the roots to grow and will naturally grow into the available ground to towards the grass. This kind of detail to front gardens is normal and will be found in edge planting areas.

We have had a prolonged dry and very hot summer, and planting would have needed additional watering and maintaining to ensure they didn’t die.

Despite being under the weather I'm still keen that we maintain momentum. I propose the following:

Good afternoon Mr Taylor,

Munster arrange their own diary and will have provided you with their first available date to visit to inspect.

Although we can appreciate that having a small draft through the bottom of the doors is not preferable, we do not deem this to be an emergency that requires urgent attention.

To mitigate the effect of the draft, we would suggest you utilise a form of draft exclusion prior to their visit.

You will be provided with feedback this week as promised following the subcontractor’s visit. I am unable to make the dates you have proposed and the earliest following available for me is the 17th November. We will also await your own contractor’s assessment / quotations as discussed at our previous meeting. In obtaining these we can look to have a productive and perhaps conclusive meeting on the 17th or another mutually agreeable date?

Good morning Mr Taylor,

As previously advised and detailed by Calford Seadon in their report, these are minor marks to external timber and do not require any action from Crest.

We have advised we will review and carry out sanding if necessary, but this is not something for the fencer to action

Good Morning Mr Taylor

We have received confirmation from our solicitors that unfortunately they have not received the signed memorandum of agreement and the land registry information for 25 Abbots Road. Consequently, we are unable to proceed with the reservation agreement for plot 34 Albany Wood.

Please can you clarify with your solicitor and ask them to forward the required competed documentation so that we can move this matter on.

Good afternoon Mr Taylor,

We now have it confirmed that your solicitors hold a signed copy of the memorandum from yourselves. Therefore, we have instructed our solicitors to sign on our behalf.

Plot 34 Albany Wood, as we have stated previously, was not released for sale at the point of your initial enquiry. Any timescales that the build manager may have intimated to you previously would have been estimates and not based on any business forecast. No legal completion dates have been provided...

Dear Mr and Mrs Taylor,
I acknowledge safe receipt of your recent emails to Peter Truscott and also to me over the last few days.
I am conscious you are keen to press ahead with the reservation meeting for 34 Albany Wood, and I can assure you that we share this wish. We are handling this with the due care and attention we believe is needed, given that some additional steps are involved which are over and above our standard reservation process. I have in mind the arrangements for the buyback, t...

I have met with Mr & Mrs Taylor today. They visited plot 34 and were extremely unhappy the plot has not progressed since their last visit in March.
They advised we have wasted their time as they believed the property would be pre plastered, they wanted to check this today, as this is the main issue in their current property.
Due to Mr Taylor being extremely disappointed and time was now limited due to Mr Taylor having an appointment, we decided the best decision would be to postpone the plans ...

Good Morning.

Please see below the responses to your enquiries below.


  1.  It was agreed by Adrian Sims that we could take our garage personnel doors as these were purchased by ourselves (it was preferred by Crest to leave a tidy hole in the garage wall than have doors installed in plot 34).  The company can not be booked until we have a moving day, at which point they can confirm if they are available to remove them and fit them in the new property.

There seems to be some confusion on point 4 on your original email.

4) Richard from Trinity Rose has asked for confirmation that his costs will be covered for the time spent dealing with Adrian Sims, at a cost of £1500.This has not been agreed or part of the memorandum of agreement.

For plot 34 survey and report, for £2,500.  I understand that this was supposed to have been a joint engagement with Trinity, but Richard has confirmed that he has not had any contact from Cre...

Good Evening

Crest Nicholson have agreed to pay all expenses in the memorandum agreement.

We have instructed Trinity Rose jointly to attend on the 11th. We have agreed to cover the cost and you have arranged for the appointment.

Dear Mr Taylor

I hope you are well and settling into your new home.

The mortgage broker fee query was raised the day of legal completion, following the completion statement being agreed.

It was communicated via our solicitors and before completion this fee did not form part of our agreement, therefore any cost associated to this, was not the responsibility of Crest Nicholson.


Kind regards
Eileen Guihen

Good morning, Mr Taylor.

Thank you for your email and for providing the picture.  We have actioned the required works to the block that was slightly higher, however, as you are aware, a garage is not built as a watertight build, and you may find some water ingress following heavy rain.  This is not deemed as a defect, and we will be taking no further action.  You can add a weather bar to the foot of the garage to assist with rain and debris blowing in which can be purchased from any good DIY/...

Good evening, Mr Taylor

I attach a copy of the survey results from our inspection of the garden at your property.

This has been produced by way of an overlay drawing from which you can see the various spot levels shown in red figures.  In overall terms there are some variations in gradient across your garden, but all sit comfortably within the NHBC requirements for gradient levels.

In these circumstances we do not consider that any additional steps need to be taken by us with respect ga...

Good afternoon, Mr Taylor,

Thank you for your email and I am sorry if you were expecting something different to what has been provided. In answer to your concerns raised in your email of 6.34pm, Thursday 5th April.

The survey provided by Trinity Rose had three main issues:

  1.  There were not enough levels taken to accurately assess the as-built gradient and construction of the garden.
  2.  Measurements were not given on the survey and no scale was provided – we therefore could not a...
