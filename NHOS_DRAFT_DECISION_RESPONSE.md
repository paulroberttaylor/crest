# Response to NHOS Draft Decision

I am grateful for the investigation into this matter and the draft decision.

I would request that the formal apology explicitly addresses:

1. **The 18-month mischaracterization**: Crest must acknowledge they incorrectly characterized structural defects as "cosmetic" and "settlement cracks" for 18 months, when their own MJA report confirms missing movement joints.

2. **The false claims**: The apology should acknowledge that the rectification work is:
   - NOT cosmetic
   - NOT a gesture of goodwill  
   - NOT unnecessary
   - But rather REQUIRED under NHBC standards

3. **The standards breach**: The NHBC standards (both 2014 and 2023) clearly require movement joints for walls exceeding 6000mm. This property has none. Crest must acknowledge this breach.

4. **The impact**: The apology should recognize the significant stress and harm caused by 18 months of denials, misrepresentations, and delays.

A generic apology without acknowledging these specific failures would not provide the accountability and closure my family needs after this ordeal.

Thank you for your consideration.
