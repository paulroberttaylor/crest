# Complete Ammunition List Against Crest Nicholson

## 1. NHOS Victory
- **Decision NHOS-2024-000512**: Upheld ALL aspects of complaint
- **Crest claimed**: "Zero breaches" - completely wrong
- **Ordered**: Structural repairs, £1,500 compensation, formal apology
- **Key finding**: Missing movement joints are structural defects, not cosmetic
- **Shareable**: No NDA can prevent distribution

## 2. Written Admissions
- **2014 Standards**: Crest admitted IN WRITING to NHOS using 2014 standards on 2022/2023 build
- **9-year-old standards**: On supposedly premium new construction
- **The question**: Just our property or all 66? Either answer is damaging

## 3. CEO Personal Liability
- **June 23, 2025**: You emailed CEO directly with MJA report
- **CEO knew**: Had structural engineer's report confirming defects
- **Still fought**: Authorized fighting NHOS for 8 more months
- **Board liability**: CEO knowingly misled board/shareholders?

## 4. NHBC Evidence
- **11:42am email**: NHBC confirmed "your concerns are valid"
- **11:57am**: Panic retraction attempt
- **Admission**: 2022 standards should have been used
- **CEO silence**: NHBC CEO won't explain retraction

## 5. Outstanding CEO Complaint (July 11, 2025)
- **£9,131.07**: Quantified losses from delays and lies
- **50+ defects**: Despite "15 inspections"
- **Trinity Rose findings**: Garage DPC at 70mm (needs 150mm minimum)
- **Proven lies**: Gutter cleaning "completed" - independent evidence proves never done
- **Response due**: July 28 - can become new NHOS case

## 6. Pattern Evidence
- **3 other properties**: Confirmed missing movement joints
- **Observable defect**: Anyone can see missing joints
- **Systematic failure**: Not isolated incident
- **Contagion risk**: Other owners will file claims

## 7. Timeline of Lies
- **18 months**: Denied structural defects
- **"Cosmetic"**: False classification
- **"Settlement"**: Blamed natural causes

## 10. Remediation Uncertainties

- **Timeline**: Cannot be determined
- **Cost escalation**: Unknown discoveries likely
- **Disruption**: Months of 100+ decibel noise
- **Pristine standard**: £40k+ to do properly

## 11. The Killer Questions
- "Can you guarantee no other defects exist?"
- "Why were 2014 standards used?"

## 13. Regulatory Investigations
- **NHBC**: Already investigating standards
- **Trading Standards**: Potential involvement
- **Building Control**: Questions about sign-offs
- **Housing Ministry**: Systemic failure angle

## 14. Corporate Vulnerabilities
- **Share price**: 2% drop = £9.8M loss
- **Loan covenants**: Quality issues trigger reviews
- **Other developments**: All under scrutiny
- **CEO reputation**: Personal failure documented
- **Board confidence**: Major questions raised

## 15. The Unanswerable
"Given you used 2014 standards, missed movement joints, had non-technical staff make structural assessments, lied about gutter cleaning, passed Stage 12 with garage DPC at half requirements, took 6 months longer than promised, and denied proven defects for 18 months - can you with 100% certainty say there are no other issues with this property?"

**The answer is NO - and they know it.**
