# Events of July 15, 2025

## Morning - Mental Health Crisis

### Initial Email to NHOS (10:58 AM)
Paul sent desperate plea to Nigel at NHOS:
- Mentioned seeing GP for stress
- Family (Paul, Jade, son) all ill from situation
- Begged for decision after 8 months waiting
- Mentioned being unable to give full context due to Crest's NDA refusal
- "Going down a very dark path"

### Vodafone Default Discovery
- Paul discovered £156 default on credit report from Vodafone
- No knowledge of having Vodafone account
- Paid immediately to show good faith
- Contacted Vodafone via Twitter for urgent removal
- Major concern: Default would trap family in Crest house (can't get new mortgage)

### Mental State
- Paul expressed thoughts about "not wanting to be anymore"
- Jade dealing with both parents having dementia
- Paul trying to shield Jade from Vodafone default news
- 4 years of fighting Crest has taken severe toll

## Afternoon - NHOS Victory

### Draft Decision Received
**Case NHOS-2024-000512 - UPHELD**

Key points:
- Crest must implement all MJA report recommendations
- Structural engineer confirmed missing movement joints
- £1,500 compensation ordered
- Formal apology required addressing:
  - Initial construction quality
  - Failed repair quality  
  - Customer persistence required
- Work to be programmed within one week of final decision

### Paul's Response to NHOS
Requested apology must specifically acknowledge:
1. 18-month mischaracterization as "cosmetic"
2. Work is NOT gesture of goodwill but required under NHBC
3. NHBC standards require movement joints for walls >6000mm
4. Significant stress and harm caused

## Strategic Decisions

### Email to Mark Nelson (NHBC)
- Informed him of NHOS victory
- Reinforced questions about 2014 standards on 2023 build
- Highlighted Crest calling required work "unnecessary" for 18 months

### CEO/Chairman Email
- Drafted but decided to wait until after 10-day comment period
- Don't want to risk affecting NHOS decision
- Will send once decision is final and binding

## Revelations

### At Crest HQ
Likely panic mode:
- NHOS structural defect ruling
- Active CEO complaint demanding £8,136.87
- NHBC investigating 2014 standards across 66 homes
- Risk of public exposure

### Paul's Realization
- Victory feels hollow due to exhaustion
- Vodafone default threatens to trap them even with victory
- Considering buyback as ultimate goal after final decision
- "I have nothing left to give"

## Current Status
- 10 working days for NHOS comments (decision not yet final)
- Awaiting Crest response to CEO complaint (5 days)
- Vodafone default resolution urgent
- GP appointment needed for mental health
- Strategic silence until NHOS decision final

## The Paradox
Won the battle after 18 months but discovered credit default that could prevent escape from the house they proved is defective. Victory undermined by new crisis.
