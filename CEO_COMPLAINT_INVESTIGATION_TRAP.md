# CEO Complaint Investigation Requirements

## Strategy
The CEO complaint includes specific investigation requirements designed to:
1. Create burdensome work for Crest
2. Generate evidence when they fail to properly investigate
3. Strengthen NHOS complaint #2 when escalated

## Key Investigation Demands

### 1. The 15 Inspections Documentation
**Request**: "I require documentation of all 15 inspections claimed by your build manager, including dates, inspector names, and inspection reports"

**Why it's effective**:
- Build manager claimed "approximately 15 times" to Trinity Rose
- They likely don't have proper documentation
- If they do, it will show incompetence (missed 50+ defects)
- If they don't, it proves inspections were inadequate/fictional

### 2. Stage 12 Inspector Credentials
**Request**: "Evidence of the inspector's qualifications, training records, and the inspection checklist used"

**Why it's effective**:
- Stage 12 declared "no further works required" on October 6
- Trinity Rose found 50+ defects just 19 days later
- Forces them to either:
  - Admit inspector wasn't qualified
  - Admit process was flawed
  - Provide damning documentation
  - Ignore request (evidence for NHOS)

## Expected Outcome
Crest will likely:
- Provide vague, incomplete responses
- Claim records are "not available"
- Offer generic policy documents instead of specific records
- Skip these requests entirely

Any of these responses become powerful evidence for NHOS complaint #2 showing:
- Failure to maintain proper quality records
- Inability to substantiate their claims
- Unwillingness to investigate serious allegations
- Systematic quality control failures

## Timeline
- July 9: Complaint sent
- July 14: 5-day acknowledgment deadline
- July 19: 10-day path to resolution deadline
- September 3: 56-day deadline for full resolution
- September 4: Can escalate to NHOS with evidence of inadequate investigation
