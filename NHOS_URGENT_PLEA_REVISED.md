# Revised NHOS Urgent Plea

Good morning,

I am begging for this complaint to be concluded. It will be 8 months on Friday since it was accepted by the NHOS and the length of time it is taking has made me very ill - my GP is very concerned about not only myself but my wife and son.  

I haven't been able to give full context because Crest's CEO has refused permission to discuss our previous property experience (which resulted in a buyback) - he refused without providing any justification whatsoever.

I don't know how to make this clearer, but I desperately need a decision on this complaint so that I can have something concrete to confirm what I've been fighting for 19 months.

I have a lot of pride, but I am begging for a decision. Please - there is no more information that can be gained. The case has been with the Ombudsman for a draft decision for weeks. My mental health is deteriorating rapidly.

I desperately need someone to help get this concluded before irreparable harm is done to my family.

Thanks,
Paul
