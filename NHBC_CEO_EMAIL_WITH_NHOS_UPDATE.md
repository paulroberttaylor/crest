**Subject: Urgent Escalation: Inconsistent Advice and Application of NHBC Standards - Case 25/20019**

Dear Mr Wood,

I am writing to you directly to escalate a serious inconsistency in the handling of my case and to request your urgent clarification on the NHBC's formal position regarding the standards applicable to my home, which was constructed in 2022/2023.

**Update: NHOS Decision**
Yesterday, the New Homes Ombudsman Service upheld my complaint (NHOS-2024-000512) against Crest Nicholson. The builder has been ordered to:
- Pay £1,500 compensation
- Issue a comprehensive formal apology
- Implement all structural engineer's recommendations including complete render removal and installation of movement joints
- Conduct invasive work on underlying blockwork to meet NHBC standards

This decision validates concerns that Crest denied for 18 months. While I cannot share the draft decision due to confidentiality, the final decision will be available after the comment period (around July 25, 2025).

**NHBC's Contradictory Communications**
This morning, I received two contradictory emails from your claims department:

**Initial Advice (11:42 AM):** The first email confirmed, after consultation with your technical team, that my concerns about the builder using 2014 standards were valid. It explicitly stated that "your concerns are valid" and confirmed that "for a home built in 2022/2023, the applicable standards should be those in force at the time the foundations were laid—typically the 2022 NHBC Standards."

**Retracted Advice (11:59 AM):** Just 17 minutes later, this initial email was recalled, and a revised version was sent. The new email completely removed the section clarifying the applicable standards, the validity of my warranty, and the potential for NHBC intervention.

**Formal Clarification Required:**
Given this sequence of events, I require a formal explanation for the following:
1. Why was this crucial advice, provided by your team after a technical consultation, deliberately retracted?
2. Which email reflects the official and final position of the NHBC? As this initial advice was clear and unambiguous, I am currently proceeding on the basis that the 2022 NHBC Standards are the correct benchmark, as stated in your team's first email.

**Wider Implications and Failure to Enforce Standards:**
Crest Nicholson has already admitted in writing (via Crest's own legal department to the NHOS) that 2014 Standards were used for my property. This is in direct contradiction to your team's initial assessment.

This raises the significant concern that this is a systemic failure affecting all 66 properties on this development. As the UK's leading warranty provider, I expect the NHBC to investigate whether there has been a widespread failure to build to the correct standards.

**Confirmation of Specific Technical Requirements:**
Finally, based on your technical team's initial, correct assessment that 2022 Standards apply, I require a simple "yes" or "no" confirmation on the following technical points which have been disputed by the builder for 18 months and which I already requested clarification on (Wed 9 Jul, 11:51):

1. Are movement joints required under NHBC Standards for rendered brick walls exceeding 6 metres in length?
2. Should the absence of these required joints have been identified as a clear defect when first reported, rather than 18 months later and only after my insistence on a professional's report?
3. Was the builder's classification of this structural requirement as "cosmetic," "unnecessary," or a "gesture of goodwill" incorrect under the applicable 2022 Standards?

Given the seriousness of this matter, the contradictory advice issued by your staff, and the NHOS decision confirming these are genuine structural defects, I look forward to a prompt and direct response from your office clarifying the NHBC's definitive position.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Robert Taylor
