## 1. Introduction

1.1. MJA Consulting has been commissioned by Crest Nicholson to undertake a visual inspection and assessment of reported cracking to the elevations of plot 34 on the Albany Farm development in Bishops Waltham.

1.2. The inspection was conducted on the 22nd May 2025 from ground level only and were non-intrusive.

1.3. The weather at the time of the survey was fine and dry.

1.4. This is the first time we have inspected the property, and I met with the home owner only, there was no representation from Crest Nicholson at the inspection.

1.5. We were not the appointed engineers for the development, and we have no prior knowledge of the development.

1.6. We have not been provided any information other than the working drawings for Plot 34.

1.7. We have not inspected the foundations or undertaken any assessment on the foundations as part of this investigation.

1.8. The standard housetype calculations referred to below are from MJA Consulting as we are Crest Nicholsons appointed structural engineers for the assessment and design of standard housetypes.

1.9. This technical note deals with the assessment of the cracking and elevational treatment.

## 2. Observations

2.1. The property is a Dorking housetype and is constructed with concrete facing bricks from ground floor level to first floor level and rendered at first floor level to eaves.

2.2. The property is orientated with the front elevation facing South.

2.3. There has been a crack to the western side gable elevation, which is approximately half way along the elevation within the upper render section. The crack has been repaired on two occasions (I was informed by the homeowner), however the repair is visible.

2.4. A crack was also noted to the front elevation propagating from the cast cill to the ensuite, the crack is vertical and runs to the lead flashing of the porch roof.

2.5. A crack was noted on the eastern gable elevation at the junction of the eaves.

## 3. Assessment

3.1. Below are extracts from the standard housetype calculations which identify the movement joint requirements, and bedjoint reinforcement requirements.

[Note: Pages 5-7 contained technical calculations/drawings not transcribed in the original text]

## 4. Recommendations

4.1. **The cracking to the render is likely being caused by shrinkage/movement of the blockwork to the external elevation.** Several factors could be contributing to this, which could include but not limited to the following:
- lack of movement joints
- lack of bedjoint reinforcement
- green blocks being laid at the time of construction

4.2. The cracking within the external elevations is superficial and will not affect the long term performance of the property in terms of structural integrity **however cracking to the render may accelerate the degradation of the finish and lead to an early failure of the render**, it is also aesthetically unpleasing. From my understanding after discussing with the home owner, the house is proposed to be re-rendered entirely to rectify the defects and provide a consistent appearance. **It is likely that due to the issues with the cracking within the render that further movement joints should be cut into the east and west elevations to mitigate further cracking once the property has been re-rendered.**

4.3. Once the render has been removed we would recommend that a visual inspection is undertaken on the blockwork to determine if further remedials are required before the render is reapplied.

4.4. We will provide further recommendations once the render has been removed and an inspection undertaken.

## Key Findings Summary

### Root Causes Identified:
- **Blockwork shrinkage/movement** - not "minor settlement" as Crest claimed
- **Lack of movement joints** in construction
- Possible lack of bedjoint reinforcement
- Possible use of green blocks during construction

### Critical Points:
1. **Render will fail early** without proper remediation
2. **Movement joints ARE needed** on east and west elevations
3. **Further inspection required** after render removal
4. **Multiple cracks observed** on three elevations (west, front, east)
5. **Previous repairs have already failed** (western gable repaired twice)

### Contradicts Crest's Position:
- Not just "superficial" - structural movement in blockwork
- Re-rendering without movement joints would fail
- Validates Paul's 18-month concerns about render defects
