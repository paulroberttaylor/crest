# Plot 34 Contract and Completion Delays - Comprehensive Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive evidence of the contract delays and multiple completion date changes for Plot 34 (10 Colt View), showing how Crest Nicholson repeatedly delayed the property completion from an initial estimate of June/July 2023 to the actual completion on December 18, 2023.

## Key Timeline Summary

### Initial Promise vs Reality
- **Site Manager's Initial Estimate**: June/July 2023
- **Actual Completion**: December 18, 2023
- **Total Delay**: 5-6 months

### Completion Date Changes

1. **Early 2023**: Site manager indicates June/July 2023 completion when Paul and Jade viewed the plot under construction

2. **May 18, 2023**: First documented delay
   - Paul emails Adrian Sims questioning why solicitors were told September/October when "the building team were confident it would be ready in June or July"

3. **September 2023**: October set as target
   - Sales rep mentions they're "not allowed holidays in October" - indicating October was the critical completion month

4. **October 7, 2023**: Paul criticizes Crest's timeline
   - Email to Steve Smith: "not enough time to meet your end of year targets for an end of October completion"
   - Shows October 31 was Crest's target, not Paul's choice

5. **October 10, 2023**: The "Ridiculous" Exchange
   - **5:19 PM** - Natalie Haigh (Crest): "We don't currently believe 25th October is achievable for completion, but working towards an October completion as per the reservation agreement"
   - **5:50 PM** - Paul Taylor: "Please explain why 25th October is not achievable, when there are only four working days until the end of the month"
   - October 25 was a Wednesday, October 31 was a Tuesday
   - Only 4 working days difference (Thu 26, Fri 27, Mon 30, Tue 31)

6. **October 24, 2023**: Critical Failure
   - **9:47 AM** - Hannah Rafferty (solicitor) confirms: "I do not believe we will be ready to complete on 31st October. We need the updated contract and full replies to the enquiries"
   - This was just 7 days before the planned completion

7. **December 11-13, 2023**: Frantic Exchange Attempts
   - Multiple "URGENT" emails
   - December 12: "Your solicitor has requested an exchange today with completion on 18th December"
   - Last possible completion date: December 20, 2023

8. **December 18, 2023**: Finally Completed

## Evidence of Poor Treatment

### Contract Issues
1. **Missing Documentation**
   - Updated contract not provided by Crest in time
   - Full replies to enquiries not provided
   - Contract described as "vastly different from standard"

2. **Communication Failures**
   - October 12, 2023: Paul notes "Crest are not appreciating...the fact that these companies aren't just waiting around" (regarding removals bookings)
   - Multiple emails showing Paul having to chase for responses
   - Crest setting deadlines that suited them, not the buyers

3. **Broken Promises**
   - Site manager's June/July estimate proven completely unrealistic
   - October 31 completion promised but not delivered
   - No adequate explanation for why October 25 was "not achievable"

### Key Emails Showing Delays

#### May 18, 2023 - First Documented Concern
**From:** Paul Taylor  
**To:** Adrian Sims  
**Content:** "why our solicitor has been informed that plot 34 will be ready in September or October, when the building team were confident it would be ready in June or July?"

#### October 24, 2023 - Solicitor Confirms Failure
**From:** Hannah Rafferty <hr@bramsdonandchilds.com>  
**To:** Paul Taylor, Serhan Handani, Jade Taylor  
**Subject:** RE: URGENT  
**Content:** "I do not believe we will be ready to complete on 31st October. We need the updated contract and full replies to the enquiries."

#### December 13, 2023 - Still Chasing
**From:** Hannah Rafferty  
**Content:** "I am chasing for the redemption statement but I do not see why this should be delaying exchange"

## Pattern of Behavior

1. **Crest's Priorities Over Buyers' Needs**
   - October completion was for Crest's "end of year targets"
   - Refused October 25 (buyer's only available date) but insisted on October 31
   - No consideration for buyers' arrangements (removals, mortgage, etc.)

2. **Systematic Delays**
   - Pattern of pushing dates back without adequate notice
   - Failing to provide necessary documentation on time
   - Creating artificial obstacles (contract amendments, consent issues)

3. **Impact on Buyers**
   - Had to rebook removals multiple times
   - Mortgage arrangements affected
   - Significant stress and inconvenience
   - Financial implications of delays

## Conclusion

The evidence shows a clear pattern of Crest Nicholson:
- Making unrealistic promises about completion dates
- Prioritizing their internal targets over buyers' needs
- Failing to provide necessary documentation in a timely manner
- Offering no reasonable explanation for refusing dates that suited the buyers
- Causing significant delays through poor administration and communication

The total delay of 5-6 months from the initial estimate, combined with the last-minute notification of delays, demonstrates a systematic failure to treat buyers fairly and professionally.
