# NHOS Draft Decision Comments - Submitted July 17, 2025

I am grateful for the investigation into this matter and the draft decision.

As per the NHOS guildeline glossary, a failure to install movement joints is contrary to NHBC standards (whether 2014 or 2022), and contitutes a 'major defect, which I would be grateful it the final decision included to highlight that this is not unnecessary or a goodwill gesture:

"Major defect 
A fault or failure (usually a structural fault) that could lead to an insurance claim through the new home warranty".

I would request that the formal apology also explicitly addresses:

1. The 18-month mischaracterisation: Crest to acknowledge they incorrectly characterised structural defects as "cosmetic", "unnecessary", and "gesture of goodwill", and nothing more than "settlement" for 18 months, when their own MJA report confirms missing movement joints (as per NHBC standards in either 2014 standards the builder admits to using, or the relevant 2022 standards that should have been used).

2. These claims: The apology should acknowledge that the rectification work is:
   - not cosmetic
   - not a gesture of goodwill
   - not unnecessary
   - but rather required under NHBC standards

The apology needs to:
- acknowlege that for 15 months before the MJA survey was arranged, the builder maintained with no professional backing to do so, that the issue was settlement.  
- admit that a professional should have been engaged in January 2024 when it was raised, by a third party if necessary if the skill isn't found in-house
- acknowledge that continuing to gaslight the issue as goodwill even after the MJA was clear in its findings was abhorrent beheaviour
- acknowledge that Crest knew what the actual problem was from January 2024 and their actions until now have been to preven that being admitted or for the structural work to be carried out, or conversely, that no staff had any idea of the root cause of the cracking yet still maintained that it was settlement.  It is imperative that an apology addresses this.


3. The standards: The NHBC standards (both 2014 and 2023) clearly require movement joints for walls exceeding 6000mm of mixed materials

4. The impact: The apology should recognise the significant stress and harm caused by 18 months of denials, misrepresentations, and delays.

A generic apology without acknowledging these specific failures would not provide the accountability and closure my family needs after this ordeal.

I would also request that this apology comes from Crest Nicholson's CEO. The CEO was personally aware of these issues in 2024 and I feel that given this, the written apology should come from the CEO themselves.

Thank you for your consideration.
