# Email to Dr. Wade-West

Dear Dr. Wade-West,

Thank you for seeing Jade this afternoon. Following our discussion about the mental health impacts of our situation with Crest Nicholson, I'm providing this detailed background to help structure your letter to their CEO.

**Our Goal**
We need to exit this property. The psychological toll of living in another defective Crest home, after being promised it would be different, is unbearable.

**Key Message for Your Letter**
This family cannot continue living in a property they fundamentally cannot trust, built by a company that has systematically deceived them across two properties.

## The Trust Destruction Timeline

**1. False Promises (2023)**
After the 25 Abbots Road buyback, senior Crest management explicitly promised us: "This won't happen again." We trusted them. We bought Plot 34 based on that assurance.

**2. Immediate Betrayal (May-December 2023)**
**Contract Obstruction**: 
- 149 days from promise to exchange
- Solicitors unable to get responses from Crest
- Lost our mortgage rate due to delays (costing Â£8,136.87)
- Constant anxiety about whether purchase would even happen

**Construction Abandonment**:
- May-August 2023: ZERO progress on property
- Their own sales manager documented we were "extremely unhappy the plot has not progressed since March"
- Promised June/July completion became December
- Clear message: We weren't a priority, despite promises

**Completion Chaos**:
- Exchange only 5 days before completion (December 13)
- Dozens of frantic calls/emails in final weeks
- Had to personally call Sales Director for keys on completion day
- Moved into property with 45 defects

This was their chance to prove 25 Abbots Road was an anomaly. Instead, they demonstrated identical contempt for our family.

**3. Immediate Trust Erosion (October 2023)**
Within days of their "Stage 12 passed" claim, Trinity Rose found:
- Garage DPC at less than half required height
- Open soil vent pipe in loft
- Unsealed roof void with gaps
- Multiple NHBC violations

We lost all confidence in the property's construction quality. What else had they done wrong?

**4. The Render Denial (January 2024 - Present)**
- 18 months of being told the crack was "minor settlement"
- Gaslit about our concerns being unreasonable
- Finally vindicated by MJA report showing structural defects
- But now terrified about what other structural issues exist

**5. The 2014 Standards Revelation (June 2025)**
Learning they built our 2023 home to 2014 standards destroyed any remaining trust. If they cut corners on standards, where else did they cut corners?

## Current Mental Health Crisis

**Hypervigilance and Paranoia**
- Every sound could be another structural issue
- Every crack might be another missing movement joint
- Can't sleep properly - listening for problems
- Checking walls obsessively for new cracks

**Inability to Settle**
- Can't make the house a home knowing it's fundamentally flawed
- Won't improve garden - what's the point?
- Son unsettled - knows something's wrong with our house again
- Living in limbo - not a home, just temporary accommodation

**Cognitive Overload**
- Forced to become building experts to protect ourselves
- Hundreds of hours researching building standards and construction requirements that Crest - a building company - should already know
- Had to learn about movement joints, NHBC standards, render systems because Crest lacks basic technical knowledge
- They needed to hire MJA Consulting to tell them what any competent builder should know
- Mental capacity consumed by filling Crest's knowledge gaps
- Work and family life suffering because we have to educate a "5-star builder" about building

**Relationship Impact**
- Constant Crest discussions dominating our marriage
- Jade feeling we're reliving 25 Abbots trauma
- Both triggered by any house-related issue
- Normal life impossible while fighting for basics

**Physical Symptoms**
- Chronic headaches
- Disrupted sleep
- Anxiety symptoms when post arrives
- Jade experiencing [her specific symptoms]
- Both showing signs of chronic stress

## The Impossibility of Continuing

We cannot psychologically invest in a property where:
- The builder used obsolete standards
- 50+ defects were missed by their inspections
- Their own engineer confirms structural problems exist
- They've lied repeatedly ("gutters cleaned", "build complete")
- We have zero trust in construction quality

## What We Face Next

The family faces the prospect of:
- Scaffolding around their entire home AGAIN (after already enduring it once for pointless work)
- Having render chipped off every wall of their house
- Movement joints cut into the walls (structural work Crest calls "unnecessary")
- Complete re-rendering of the property
- Unknown additional issues that can only be identified once render is removed
- Months of disruption for work that should have been done correctly initially

The MJA report was explicit: These are NOT cosmetic issues. Without proper fixes, "early failure of the render" is likely. Render provides weather protection - failure leads to water ingress and structural damage. Yet Crest continues gaslighting us, calling it "merely cosmetic" with "no long-term impact."

## Medical Perspective Needed

Please emphasize in your letter:

1. **Pattern Recognition Trauma**: Having experienced identical issues at 25 Abbots Road, we're now hypervigilant and cannot psychologically settle

2. **Betrayal Trauma**: Explicitly promised different experience, received same treatment - devastating impact on ability to trust

3. **Ongoing Uncertainty**: Living with constant worry about undiscovered defects is causing chronic stress symptoms

4. **Child Welfare**: Our son's inability to see his home as stable/safe due to repeated scaffolding and parents' visible stress

5. **Impossibility of Resolution**: No amount of repairs can restore psychological safety in this property - trust is irreparably broken

## Medical Recommendation

From a medical perspective, this family needs to exit this property for their mental health. The pattern of corporate behavior across two properties has created a situation where living in any Crest-built home is psychologically harmful.

The psychological impact of facing months more disruption for work that should have been done correctly initially, combined with Crest's continued misrepresentation of serious structural issues as "cosmetic," makes remaining in this property untenable for the family's mental health.

The only therapeutic resolution is complete separation from Crest Nicholson through property buyback, allowing the family to start fresh with a different builder where trust hasn't been systematically destroyed.

## Supporting Evidence
- Previous medical letters regarding 25 Abbots Road
- 544 days of fighting about render
- Discovery of 2014 building standards usage
- Pattern of misrepresentation to regulators
- CEO ignoring direct evidence
- MJA report confirming structural defects

Thank you for your continued support. Please let me know if you need any additional information for your letter.

Kind regards,
Paul
