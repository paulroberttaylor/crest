# Email to Dr. Wade-West

Dear Dr. Wade-West,

Thank you for seeing Jade yesterday afternoon. Following your discussion about the mental health impacts of our situation with Crest Nicholson, I'm providing this detailed background to help structure your letter to their CEO.

**Our Goal**
We need to exit this property. The psychological toll of living in another defective Crest home, after being promised it would be different, is unbearable.

**Key Message for Your Letter**
This family cannot continue living in a property they fundamentally cannot trust, built by a company that has systematically deceived them across two properties.

## Current Impact on Our Family

**Charlie (Our Son)**
- Cannot settle in what should be his home
- Knows scaffolding is coming again after already experiencing it in this property once
- Doesn't want to be in the area anymore
- Witnessing his parents' constant stress and worry

**Jade and I**
- Can't sleep properly - worrying about what's wrong
- Constant anxiety about undiscovered defects
- Unable to make this house a home
- Won't improve the garden - scaffolding will damage it again (they never fixed it last time)
- Living in limbo - this is temporary accommodation, not our home
- Marriage dominated by Crest discussions instead of normal family life
- Both showing physical signs of chronic stress
- Jade feeling we're reliving the 25 Abbots Road trauma

**Daily Life**
- Forced to become building experts to protect ourselves
- Hundreds of hours researching what Crest - a building company - should know
- Mental capacity consumed by fighting for basics
- Work and family life suffering
- Normal life impossible while battling a corporation

## How We Got Here - The Trust Destruction Timeline

**1. False Promises (2023)**
After the 25 Abbots Road buyback, senior Crest management explicitly promised us: "There would be no repeat of 25 Abbots Road." We trusted them. We bought Plot 34 based on that assurance.

**2. Immediate Issues (May-December 2023)**
**Contract Obstruction**: 
- 149 days from being promised the contract to exchange
- They promised it 'next week', and it took a further 45 days to receive the first draft
- Solicitors unable to get responses from Crest
- Constant anxiety about whether purchase would even happen
- Mortgage offer expiring, adding pressure to an already stressful situation 

**Construction Abandonment**:
- Around March to May 2023: ZERO progress on property. Not just some, literally none.
- Their own sales manager documented we were "extremely unhappy the plot has not progressed since March"
- June/July completion date by site manager became a December completion
- Clear message: We weren't a priority, despite promises

**Completion**:
- Exchange only 5 days before completion (December 13)
- Dozens of frantic calls/emails in final weeks
- Had to personally call Sales Director for keys on completion day
- Moved into property with 45 defects

This was their chance to prove 25 Abbots Road was an anomaly. Instead, they demonstrated identical contempt for our family.

**3. Immediate Trust Erosion (October 2023)**
A 'Stage 12' check is apparently their expert quality check on a building before handover. Within days of their "Stage 12 passed" claim, Trinity Rose found:
- Garage DPC at less than half required height
- Open soil vent pipe in loft
- Unsealed roof void with gaps
- Multiple NHBC violations

We lost all confidence in the property's construction quality. What else had they done wrong?

**4. Render Issue (January 2024 - Present)**
- Within 4 weeks of moving in, a full height crack appeared in the render
- When I eventually was able to have someone come to look, it was a customer service manager, who claimed it was settlement
- 18 months of being told the crack was "minor settlement", it isn't necessary, it's cosmetic, and it's 'goodwill' (the render company told me it's the re-render alone would cost about Â£10k so how Crest can claim they're spend that kind of money for goodwill is beyond me)
- Gaslit about our concerns being unreasonable
- Finally vindicated by MJA report showing structural defects, but only after I fought for approximately 15 months for them to have a professional actually verify their claim of settlement.  Within seconds of the surveyor being on our property, he told me it isn't settlement.
- But now terrified about what other structural issues exist

**5. The 2014 Standards Revelation (June 2025)**
I started a complaint with the New Homes Ombudsman (NHOS),  the only reason Crest decided to act.  As part of the NHOS's questions, they asked Crest which NHBC standards they used. It's in writing that Crest used 2014 standards. So on top of learning that there are structural issues that they tried to avoid doing by not accepting there's something more than settlement, we now have the knowledge that they didn't use 2023 standards, but almost 10 years out of date standards, which now has us wondering what _else_ may be wrong with the property.  We wouldn't know however, because Crest would just claim it's something else. We consequently can have no trust in anything they tell us.

## Why We Cannot Continue

We cannot psychologically invest in a property where:
- The builder used obsolete standards
- 50+ defects were missed by their inspections
- Their own engineer confirms structural problems exist
- They've lied repeatedly ("gutters cleaned", "build complete") - I used a drone to prove the gutters hadn't been cleared, which could have led to blocked drains
- We have zero trust in construction quality

**We're Trapped**:
- Can't sell without the work being done - we'd have to disclose known structural defects
- Can't sell after the work is done - we'd have to disclose major structural remediation
- Either way, buyers will run or demand massive price reductions
- We're stuck in a property that's psychologically destroying us

## What We Face Next

Our family faces the prospect of:
- Scaffolding around their entire home AGAIN (after already enduring it once for pointless work)
- Having render smashed off every wall of their house
- Movement joints cut into the walls (structural work Crest calls "unnecessary")
- Complete re-rendering of the property
- Unknown additional issues that can only be identified once render is removed
- Months of disruption for work that should have been done correctly initially

The MJA report was explicit: These are NOT cosmetic issues. Without proper fixes, "early failure of the render" is likely. Render provides weather protection - failure leads to water ingress and structural damage. Yet Crest continues gaslighting us, calling it "merely cosmetic" with "no long-term impact."

## Medical Perspective Needed

Please could you emphasize in your letter:

1. **Pattern Recognition Trauma**: Having experienced identical issues at 25 Abbots Road, we're now hypervigilant and cannot psychologically settle

2. **Betrayal Trauma**: Explicitly promised "no repeat" - the broken promise has destroyed our ability to trust

3. **Chronic Stress**: The physical and mental symptoms we're experiencing from living with constant uncertainty

4. **Child Welfare**: Charlie's inability to feel secure in his own home

5. **Impossibility of Resolution**: No repairs can restore psychological safety when trust is completely broken

## Medical Recommendation

From a medical perspective, this family needs to exit this property for their mental health. The pattern of corporate behavior across two properties has created a situation where living in any Crest-built home is psychologically harmful.

The psychological impact of facing months more disruption for work that should have been done correctly initially, combined with Crest's continued misrepresentation of serious structural issues as "cosmetic," makes remaining in this property untenable for the family's mental health.

The only therapeutic resolution is complete separation from Crest Nicholson through property buyback, allowing the family to start fresh with a different builder where trust hasn't been systematically destroyed.


Thank you for your continued support. Please let me know if you need any additional information for your letter.

Kind regards,
Paul
