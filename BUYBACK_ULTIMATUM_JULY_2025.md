# Buyback Ultimatum - July 2025

## Background
Following the collapse of our house sale due to buyer chain failure, and with new evidence of serious corporate fraud, this represents the final opportunity for Crest Nicholson to resolve this matter before public exposure.

## New Evidence (July 23, 2025)

### 1. NHBC Standards Fraud
- **NHBC Confirmation**: Property registered September 28, 2022 = 2022 Standards mandatory
- **Crest Admission**: Used 2014 standards (8 years out of date)
- **NHBC Statement**: "no permission has been given by NHBC to build using any NHBC Standards other than those applicable"
- **Impact**: Entire Albany Road development (66 homes) built fraudulently

### 2. False NHBC "Sign Off" Claims
- **September 28, 2023**: Natalie Haigh - "NHBC sign off"
- **January 25, 2024**: Lynn Carrington - "The NHBC have approved our standard drawings and signed off the property"
- **July 23, 2025**: NHBC - "we do not 'sign off' homes as defect free"
- **Conclusion**: Crest lied about regulatory approval to force completion

### 3. Weber Manufacturer Warnings
- Mandated render work will "undoubtable destroy" the wall faces
- Work is "very messy, very disruptive and very noisy"
- Will cause "more harm than good"
- Should only be done "as a last resort"

## The Ultimatum

### Option 1: Immediate Buyback
- Current market value: Â£700,000
- Plus all associated costs and compensation
- Clean exit for both parties
- Avoids destruction of property
- Prevents public scandal

### Option 2: Public Exposure Campaign
If no satisfactory buyback offer within 7 days:

1. **Criminal Complaints**
   - Trading Standards: False NHBC claims
   - Building Control: 2014 vs 2022 standards fraud
   - Police: Corporate fraud investigation

2. **Media Blitz**
   - BBC Watchdog feature ready
   - National newspaper investigations
   - Social media campaign launch
   - Website: crestnicholsonreviews.co.uk goes live

3. **Regulatory Actions**
   - NHBC formal complaint affecting all 66 Albany Road homes
   - Parliamentary inquiry request
   - Shareholder notifications

4. **Class Action**
   - Contact all Albany Road buyers about standards fraud
   - Coordinate mass NHBC claims
   - Pattern evidence from two defective properties

## Timeline
- **Ultimatum Sent**: July 24, 2025
- **Response Deadline**: July 31, 2025
- **Campaign Launch**: August 1, 2025 (if no buyback)

## The Choice
Crest can either:
- Pay for their mistakes privately with a buyback
- Face public destruction of their reputation

## Note
This is not a threat - it's a promise. Four years of documented failures, two defective houses, and now proven fraud. The evidence is overwhelming and the campaign is ready to launch.
