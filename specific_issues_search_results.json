Their opinion is that 75mm is sufficient and is generally accepted, as the splash zone is reduced, as the length of the wall in question is minimal and it wouldn\u2019t cause a major concern.\r\n\r\nThe technical standards state a damp-proof course should be at least 150mm above the level of the adjoining ground, but it is for guidance only. This is to stop rising damp from adjacent ground. However, the risk of rising damp is further mitigated using 3 courses of engineering brick.\r\n\r\nA garage is not deemed habitable and is constructed of si..."

Sadly, the only compromises have been from my wife and I,\r\nbut I appreciate we're now at the point where nothing more can be gained,\r\nalthough we will broach the subject of the garage doors. My main concern\r\nwas that the confidentiality agreement would be valid regardless of whether\r\nthe buy back happened or not.\r\n\r\nThere are prerequisites that need to be confirmed (the email to, and\r\nresponse from, the NHBC about the agreement) before the memorandum is\r\nsigned so we will email the NHBC today.\r\n\r\nIs the rest of the process done via solicitors or do we need to communicate\r\nwith Crest regarding the memorandum of sale? They have told us that they\r\nwill be instructing their own solici..."
