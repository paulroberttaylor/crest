# Buyback Negotiation Strategy

## Phase 1: Initial Contact (After NHOS Final Decision)
Use CEO_BUYBACK_HINT_LETTER.md emphasizing:
- NHOS decision upholding all aspects
- Health crisis with medical evidence
- 2014 standards question
- Other properties affected
- Previous "pragmatic decision-making"

## Phase 2: If They Engage
**Don't reveal specific numbers yet**

Response framework:
"Any resolution would need to address both the property situation and my outstanding complaint, as well as a gesture of goodwill to enable settling into a new property an enjoyable experience - something we have not had in either Crest property."

## Phase 3: Negotiation Points

### Must-Haves
- Property purchase at current value (£725,000+)
- All moving costs covered
- CEO complaint settled (£9,131.07)
- No NDA on this property

### Negotiables
- Ongoing housing costs during transition
- "Goodwill gesture" amount
- Timeline for completion
- Public statements about resolution

## Key Leverage Reminders
1. **Immediate**: Remediation costs £27-35k with risks
2. **3 Properties**: Additional £81-105k exposure
3. **66 Properties**: Potential £2.31M if 2014 standards development-wide
4. **Reputation**: Visible work will prompt questions
5. **Precedent**: You've done this before successfully

## Psychological Tactics
- Let them propose buyback first
- Use their "goodwill" language against them
- Reference pattern across two properties
- Don't threaten - state facts about what you've observed
- Emphasize family health over money

## Red Lines
- No partial settlements
- No remediation instead of buyback
- No lengthy delays (health can't take it)
- No gagging on NHOS decision sharing

## Timing
1. Wait for NHOS final decision
2. Wait for their formal apology
3. Send CEO hint letter
4. Give 7-10 days for response
5. If no engagement, escalate pressure

## Nuclear Options (Only if Needed)
- Share NHOS decision with all residents
- Contact other affected property owners
- Media engagement about 2014 standards
- Shareholder communications
- Social media campaign ready to launch
