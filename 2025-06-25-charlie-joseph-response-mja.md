Dear Mr Taylor

I acknowledge receipt of your emails to Martyn Clark and as the Managing Director of the Regional Business, I will continue to oversee your complaint going forward. Be assured that I will keep Martyn Clark (CEO) and Mark Foyle (Group MD) updated on any relevant developments.

Following the visual inspection conducted by MJA Consulting on May 22, 2025, regarding the reported cracking on your property's elevations, the assessment revealed the following key points:

• The observed cracking in the render is likely a result of shrinkage or movement in the blockwork of the external elevation.

• The identified cracks on the external elevations are deemed superficial and are not anticipated to have any adverse effects on the long-term performance of your property.

In line with Mark Foyle's letter dated November 20, 2024, Crest Nicholson had agreed to re-render the entire property as a goodwill gesture since rendering the entire property was considered unnecessary. It was previously communicated that the crack on the western gable was superficial and likely caused by natural shrinkage and movement.

Before proceeding with re-rendering, MJA Consulting will conduct an additional visual inspection of the blockwork to determine if further remedial actions are required prior to applying new render. This inspection is dependent on removing the existing render. We remain eager to move forward with this inspection and would appreciate setting up a suitable time for us to erect scaffolding for removal of the render.

Upon completion of this inspection, based on its findings, adjustments like adding movement joints to both east and west elevations may be included in the final scope to prevent potential future cracking issues. Our aim is for these actions to satisfactorily conclude this matter for you.

Please note, the report has been forwarded to New Homes Ombudsman Service (NHOS), under claim reference NHOS-2024-000512, for their review.

Kind regards,

Yours sincerely

Charlie Joseph  
Managing Director

## Key Points from Response

### MJA Findings Summary (per Charlie Joseph):
- Cracking likely from **shrinkage or movement in blockwork**
- Cracks deemed **"superficial"** with no long-term impact
- Additional blockwork inspection needed after render removal

### Crest's Position:
- Still framing re-render as **"goodwill gesture"** and "unnecessary"
- Movement joints only **"may be included"** based on further inspection
- References Mark Foyle's November 20, 2024 letter
- NHOS case reference: **NHOS-2024-000512**

### Notable Contradictions:
1. Admits blockwork movement but calls it "superficial"
2. Says re-render is "unnecessary" while proposing to do it anyway
3. Movement joints only "may" be added despite MJA recommendations
4. No acknowledgment of 18-month dismissal of concerns
5. No mention that MJA was only commissioned at Paul's insistence
