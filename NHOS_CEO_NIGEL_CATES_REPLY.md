# Reply to NHOS CEO Nigel Cates

**To:** Nigel Cates, CEO of NHOS
**Subject:** Re: Your complaint

Dear Nigel,

Thank you for reaching out personally. Yes, I received the draft decision yesterday and am pleased it upholds my complaint. While the wording could have been stronger based on the evidence, the outcome is the same so long as they actually do apologise. 

I should clarify that this render issue represents only a small fraction of our challenges with Crest. I submitted a comprehensive formal complaint to Crest's CEO on July 11, 2025, detailing the full scope of issues during our purchase and beyond. This may well become another NHOS complaint if not resolved satisfactorily by Crest, which I expect it not to be. Had they just treated us correctly with the render issue I would have dropped everything else for an easy life.  Since they didn't, I'm not allowing them to get away with the rest of their treatment. Unfortunately, this one will make the render complaint insignificant.

**Concerning Development**
This morning, the NHBC initially confirmed my concerns about Crest using 2014 standards on our 2022/2023 build were "valid." They then recalled that email 17 minutes later and sent a sanitized version removing this admission. This suggests the relationship between NHBC and builders may be uncomfortably close, potentially compromising their independence.  For this development, the NHBC acted as building control and warranty provider, while being funded by builders just like Crest.  If the NHOS has any ability to influence government policy, this relationship would be what I would focus on.  Until the warranty providers are not setting and then marking the homework, and paid by the students, the NHOS will be needed more than ever.

**Regarding the Apology**
In my comments on the draft decision, I've requested that Crest's apology specifically acknowledges what they did wrong - not their typical "we're sorry you feel that way" response. 

**NHOS's Value**
I understand NHOS is still new and will have growing pains, but I'm genuinely grateful it exists. Without your intervention, Crest would still be denying these issues. Your role in raising industry standards is vital, especially when other regulatory bodies appear compromised. When I am in a better head-space I will send some further observations from the perspective of a home owner dealing with a builder while waiting for a decision.

Thank you again for your personal attention to this matter.

Kind regards,
Paul
